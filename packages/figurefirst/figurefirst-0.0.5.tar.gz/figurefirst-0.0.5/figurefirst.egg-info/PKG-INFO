Description: # FigureFirst
        FigureFirst is a python 3.5+ library to decorate and parse SVG files so they can serve as layout documents for matplotlib figures.
        * See our github page for readme and examples: http://flyranch.github.io/figurefirst/
        * Read the docs: https://figurefirst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
        * Read our Scipy 2017 proceedings: http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2017/lindsay.html

        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install figurefirst
        ```
        
        ## Use with Inkscape
        FigureFirst is developed and tested with Inkscape. Some versions and settings of Inkscape are very slow. Try Inkscape 0.92: https://inkscape.org/en/release/0.92.3/
        
        ### Installing Inkscape 0.92 on Ubuntu
        You can install Inkscape 0.92 using ppa:
        * `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable`
        * `sudo apt update`
        * `sudo apt install inkscape`
        
        ### Optimizing Inkscape settings
        Try increasing the Rendering Tile Multiplier:
        * `Edit > Preference > Rending`
        * `Rendering Tile Multiplier = 50`
        Restart Inkscape
        
        ### Installing `figurefirst` extensions
        
        This package includes a console script, `figurefirst_ext` to install inkscape extensions.
        It tries to infer the default installation path for your OS (do `figurefirst_ext --help` to see what they are),
        or you can pass a path in manually, e.g..
        
        ```bash
        figurefirst_ext ~/.config/inkscape/extensions
        ```
