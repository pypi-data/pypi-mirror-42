mds-employee-timetracking
=========================
Working time recording for employees, with multiple time accounts, 
time account rules, automatic pause control and report.

Install
=======

pip install mds-employee-timetracking

Requires
========
- Tryton 4.6

HowTo
=====

Config
------
- in *Administration / Scheduler / Scheduled Actions* add your company to 
  *Recalculation of evaluations*
- in *Timetracking / Settings / Holiday* add the public holidays of your area
- the *time zone* of your company must be set, to show valid time values, 
  otherwise time values are shown in UTC
- your tryton instance must use cron, otherwise the periodic calculations will not be performed

Create tariff model
-------------------
In *Timetracking / Preferences / Tariff model*, add an entry, enter name and shorthand symbol, save.

Tab *Account rule*
..................
The account rule determines the time account to which the working time is posted.
You should use a primary time account to which all working hours are posted. 
In addition, you can create additional rules and time accounts for which 
late work or night work is booked. Time account rules can be shared between 
multiple tariff models.

- in list *account rule* click '+' and *new*
- some values are already filled out, enter name and shorthand symbol
- for the primary time account you change the fields *from* and *to* to *0:00:00*, 
  check *Sat* and *Sun*
- in the field *Type of Presence* create the entry *Work*
- in the field *Time Account* create the entry *Work* - this is the primary time 
  account for your company
- in the field *Main Time Account* select the time account *Work*
- save

Tab *Break time rule*
.....................
The break time rule causes a fixed time to be deducted as a break for a given 
daily working time. You can set several rules for different daily working hours. 
If you are not using break time control, leave the list blank.

Tab *Type of Presence*
......................
At time entry, the *Type of Presence* selects the time account rule set.

- in the field *Present:* select *Work* - this information is used by the time entry wizard
- the field *Site Work* can be left blank
- save

You have now created a simple tariff model.

Create working time model
-------------------------
The working time model determines at which times of the day and on which days your employee 
has a regular working time. From this information the weekly working time is determined.

- in *Timetracking / Preferences / Working time model*, add an entry, enter name and shorthand symbol
- in the list *Working time rule*, add one or more rows
- you can create several working time models

Create/Edit Employee
--------------------
An employee consists of a party, a Tryton user, the tariff model and the working time 
model. The *Create Employee* wizard in *Timetracking* simplifies 
creating an employee.

If you want to change an existing employee, open *Timetracking / Employees*, 
select the employee and start the wizard *Edit Employee* via the action button.

Enter times
-----------
- the employee logs on to Tryton
- in *Timetracking* double-click on *Enter Attendance* with the green plus sign
- click on *coming* or *going* - thats it

In *Timetracking / Presence time* you can also enter working times manually and change existing 
times - if they are not fixed yet.

Get a report
------------
In *Timetracking / Evaluation*, one report per month is created for each employee. 
Select one or more lines and export them via the report button in Tryton. If the evaluation 
is not updated after you have entered a woring time, the cron service in your Tryton does not work.

Evaluations of the previous month and before can be locked against changes, click on 'lock'.

Permissions
===========
This module adds five new user groups to Tryton. You can combine the permissions with each other.

- *Timetracking - Edit tariff*: The user can create or change the tariffs in his company.
- *Timetracking - Employee*: The user can enter and fix their own working hours. He can view his monthly report and output it as a report. This group is automatically assigned when editing an employee via the *Edit Employee* wizard.
- *Timetracking - Edit Employees*: The user can create or modify employees in his company. This includes creating and modifying the corresponding Tryton user. 
- *Timetracking - Edit Worktime*: The user can view and edit the monthly evaluation for all employees in his company. The user can view, change, create and delete working hours for all employees in his company.
- *Timetracking - Cronjob*: this group is reserved for Cron
