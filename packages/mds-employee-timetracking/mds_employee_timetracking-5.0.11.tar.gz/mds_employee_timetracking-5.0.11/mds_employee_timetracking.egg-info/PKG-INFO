        HowTo
        =====
        
        Config
        ------
        - in *Administration / Scheduler / Scheduled Actions* add your company to 
          *Recalculation of evaluations*
        - in *Timetracking / Settings / Holiday* add the public holidays of your area
        - the *time zone* of your company must be set, to show valid time values, 
          otherwise time values are shown in UTC
        - your tryton instance must use cron, otherwise the periodic calculations will not be performed
        
        Create tariff model
        -------------------
        In *Timetracking / Preferences / Tariff model*, add an entry, enter name and shorthand symbol, save.
        
        Tab *Account rule*
        ..................
        The account rule determines the time account to which the working time is posted.
        You should use a primary time account to which all working hours are posted. 
        In addition, you can create additional rules and time accounts for which 
        late work or night work is booked. Time account rules can be shared between 
        multiple tariff models.
        
        - in list *account rule* click '+' and *new*
        - some values are already filled out, enter name and shorthand symbol
        - for the primary time account you change the fields *from* and *to* to *0:00:00*, 
          check *Sat* and *Sun*
        - in the field *Type of Presence* create the entry *Work*
        - in the field *Time Account* create the entry *Work* - this is the primary time 
          account for your company
        - in the field *Main Time Account* select the time account *Work*
        - save
        
        Tab *Break time rule*
        .....................
        The break time rule causes a fixed time to be deducted as a break for a given 
        daily working time. You can set several rules for different daily working hours. 
        If you are not using break time control, leave the list blank.
        
        Tab *Type of Presence*
        ......................
        At time entry, the *Type of Presence* selects the time account rule set.
        
        - in the field *Present:* select *Work* - this information is used by the time entry wizard
        - the field *Site Work* can be left blank
        - save
        
        You have now created a simple tariff model.
        
        Create working time model
        -------------------------
        The working time model determines at which times of the day and on which days your employee 
        has a regular working time. From this information the weekly working time is determined.
        
        - in *Timetracking / Preferences / Working time model*, add an entry, enter name and shorthand symbol
        - in the list *Working time rule*, add one or more rows
        - you can create several working time models
        
        Create/Edit Employee
        --------------------
        An employee consists of a party, a Tryton user, the tariff model and the working time 
        model. The *Create Employee* wizard in *Timetracking* simplifies 
        creating an employee.
        
        If you want to change an existing employee, open *Timetracking / Employees*, 
        select the employee and start the wizard *Edit Employee* via the action button.
        
        Enter times
        -----------
        - the employee logs on to Tryton
        - in *Timetracking* double-click on *Enter Attendance* with the green plus sign
        - click on *coming* or *going* - thats it
        
        In *Timetracking / Presence time* you can also enter working times manually and change existing 
        times - if they are not fixed yet.
        
        Get a report
        ------------
        In *Timetracking / Evaluation*, one report per month is created for each employee. 
        Select one or more lines and export them via the report button in Tryton. If the evaluation 
        is not updated after you have entered a woring time, the cron service in your Tryton does not work.
        
        Evaluations of the previous month and before can be locked against changes, click on 'lock'.
        
        Permissions
        ===========
        This module adds five new user groups to Tryton. You can combine the permissions with each other.
