Description: # Correct Horse: A memorable passphrase generator
        
        Correct Horse is a tool for generating resonably secure but reasonably
        memorable passphrases. It does this by picking a set of words from a
        dictionary and then sorting them into an order that plausibly makes
        sense as a phrase. It can be used either as a command line tool to
        generate and print a passphrase that one might enter into another
        application or through an API to pick new passphrases for something
        like a rotating code on a WiFi network.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Command line
        
        ```
        correcthorse [-h] [-n MAX_WORDS] [-N MAX_LETTERS] [-l] [-c] [-u] [-s] [-j] [-H]
                           [-S SEPARATOR] [-f FILENAME] [-L LOCALE]
        ```
        
        Use the `-n  WORD_COUNT` or `--max_words WORD_COUNT` option to set the maximum number of words in the passphrase. Use the `-N  LETTER_COUNT` or `--max_letters LETTER_COUNT` option to set the maximum number of letters in the passphrase. You may set both
        
        
        The `-l` or `--lower-case` will cause all of the words in the passphrase to be printed in lower case while the `-c` or `--capitalise` flag will cause the first letter of each word to be capitalised. The default is to capitalise the first letter.
        
        When the words of the passphrase are printed a seperator string will be placed between then. This can be set using the `-S SEPARATOR` or `--separator SEPARATOR` option. For convenience you can use `-u` or `--underscore` to join the words with an underscore, `-s` or `--space` to join the words with a space, `-H` or `--hyphen` to join the words with a hyphen or `-j` or `--join` to simply run the words together without a separator.
        
        By default `correcthorse` will detect your locale and pick a word set that matches your local language. You can override the detected locale using the `-L LOCALE` or `--locale LOCALE` options. While great in theory, unless your language is English the chances are that currently there is no built in word file for your language. You can however specify a custom word file using the `-f FILENAME`or `--word-file FILENAME` options. 
        
        ### Use as a python module
        
        To use the `correcthorse` module through the API create an instance of the `WordSet` using `WordSet(filename=None, locale=None, encoding='UTF-8')` and then call `random_phrase(max_words=4)`.
