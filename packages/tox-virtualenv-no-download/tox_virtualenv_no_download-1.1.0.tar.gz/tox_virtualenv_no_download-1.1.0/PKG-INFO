        tox-virtualenv-no-download
        ==========================
        
        Disable virtualenv (>=14)'s downloading behaviour when running through tox.
        
        
        ## Wait, why?
        
        A few goals for test suites are *repeatability* and *speed*.  In modern
        versions of virtualenv (>=14), `virtualenv` will reach out to pypi to download
        the latest version of `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` even when it has a
        perfectly good copy of the wheeled packages on disk.
        
        A few reasons why downloading is problematic:
        - Reaching out to the network is slow.
        - pypi goes down quite often
        - You may work in a situation where installation should not come from public
          pypi.
        - If you don't have a network connection, `virtualenv` will outright *fail*.
        - Hurts repeatability as you may suddenly get a new version of `setuptools` /
          `pip`
        - `setuptools` has been unstable in the past, breaking their latest version
           and compatibility.
        
        ## How it works
        
        The downloading behaviour of `virtualenv` can be disabled either by calling
        `virtualenv --no-download` or by setting the environment variable
        `VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD`.  This tox plugin sets that environment variable
        during the virtualenv creation.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        $ pip install tox-virtualenv-no-download
        # just use tox as you usually would
        $ tox ...
        ```
