My first python package as exercise
-----------------------------------

First, create a list and pass it as argument when calling the function. This will return a sorted list. You need to print it if you want to see it.::

    >>> import my_first_python_package_cdelacombaz
    >>> bubble_sort(l)
    >>> insertion_sort(l)
    >>> quick_sort(l)
    >>> selection_sort(l)
