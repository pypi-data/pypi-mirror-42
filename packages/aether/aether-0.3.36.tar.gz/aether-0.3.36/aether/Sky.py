"""The Sky object provides user-developers with an interface to the Aether Platform
and larger functionality of cloud applications. Nearly every action taken by Aether
user-developers is built or executed by a method on the Sky object either through
direct method call or using the Sky object to pass-through a cloud operation to 
the Aether Platform ecosystem of applications and users.

The Aether Client provides a wrapper to most of the REST microservice calls that form
the foundation of the Aether ecosystem. The typical inheritance motif of the Sky object
is to receive an operating client in its constructor, then to use standard methods on the
Sky object to manage call methods on the client.

The Sky object provides the interface to the general application operating system of the
Aether Platform. In addition to this, methods are provided to give more conventional access
to high use operations like searching, cropping, and downloading through familiar direct
access to these applications using the Sky object.

In addition to this, methods are provided on the Sky object to:

1) :py:class:`~services.UserAdminServices`: manage the user and user account,
2) :py:class:`~services.AppSupportServices`: publish and interact with published applications,

For more information on these services see their respective classes.
