    I run each L{tasks.Task} one at a time but in a well-behaved
    non-blocking manner. If the task callable doesn't return a
    C{Deferred}, it better get its work done fast. You just can't get
    away with blocking in the Twisted main loop.

    You can supply a I{series} keyword containing a list of one or
    more task series that I am qualified to handle.

    This class was mostly written for testing during development, but
    it helped keep the basic functions of a worker in mind. And who
    knows; it might be useful where you want the benefits of priority
    queueing without leaving the Twisted mindset even for a moment.
