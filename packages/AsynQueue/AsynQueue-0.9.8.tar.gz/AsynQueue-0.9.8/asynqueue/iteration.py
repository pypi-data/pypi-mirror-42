Iteration, Twisted style!

This module contains multitudes; consider it carefully. It provides a
way of dealing with iterations asynchronously. The L{Deferator} yields
C{Deferred} objects, an asynchronous version of an iterator.

Even cooler is L{IterationProducer}, which I{produces} iterations to
an implementor of C{twisted.internet.interfaces.IConsumer}. You can
make one out of an iterator with L{iteratorToProducer}.

The L{Delay} object is also very useful, both as a
Deferred-after-delay callable and a way to get a C{Deferred} that
fires when an event occurs. This is the key to getting
L{process.ProcessWorker} to work so nicely via Python's standard
multiprocessing module.

    B{Defer}red-yielding iterB{ator}.
    
    Use an instance of me in place of a task result that is an
    iterable other than one of Python's built-in containers (C{list},
    C{dict}, etc.). I yield deferreds to the next iteration of the
    result and maintain an internal deferred that fires when the
    iterations are done or terminated cleanly with a call to my
    L{stop} method. The deferred fires with C{True} if the iterations
    were completed, or C{False} if not, i.e., a stop was done.

    Access the done-iterating deferred via my I{d} attribute. I also
    try to provide access to its methods attributes and attributes as
    if they were my own.

    When the deferred from my first L{next} call fires, with the first
    iteration of the underlying (possibly remote) iterable, you can
    call L{next} again to get a deferred to the next one, and so on,
    until I raise L{StopIteration} just like a regular iterable.

    B{NOTE}: There are two very important rules. First, you B{must}
    wrap my iteration in a C{defer.inlineCallbacks} loop or otherwise
    wait for each yielded deferred to fire before asking for the next
    one. Second, you must call the L{stop} method of the Deferator (or
    the deferreds it yields) before doing a C{break} or C{return} to
    prematurely terminate the loop.

    Good behavior looks something like this::

      @defer.inlineCallbacks
      def printItems(self, ID):
          for d in Deferator("remoteIterator", getMore, ID):
              listItem = yield d
              print listItem
              if listItem == "Danger Will Robinson":
                  d.stop()
                  # You still have to break out of the loop after calling
                  # the deferator's stop method
                  return

    Instantiate me with a string representation of the underlying
    iterable (or the object itself, if it's handy) and a function
    (along with any args and kw) that returns a deferred to a 3-tuple
    containing (1) the next value yielded from the task result, (2) a
    Bool indicating if this value is valid or a bogus first one from
    an empty iterator, and (3) a Bool indicating whether there are
    more iterations left.

    This requires your get-more function to be one step ahead somehow,
    returning C{False} as its status indicator when the I{next} call
    would raise L{StopIteration}. Use L{Prefetcherator.getNext} after
    setting the prefetcherator up with a suitable iterator or
    next-item callable.

    The object (or string representation) isn't strictly needed; it's
    for informative purposes in case an error gets propagated back
    somewhere. You can cheat and just use C{None} for the first
    constructor argument. Or you can supply a Prefetcherator as the
    first and sole argument, or an iterator for which a
    L{Prefetcherator} will be constructed internally.
