Miscellaneous useful stuff.

L{callAfterDeferred} is a cool little function that looks for a
C{Deferred} as an attribute of some namespace (i.e., object) and does
a call after it fires.

L{DeferredTracker} lets you to track and wait for deferreds without
actually having received a reference to them. L{DeferredLock} lets you
shut things down when you get the lock.

L{CallRunner} is used by L{threads.ThreadWorker} and
L{process.ProcessWorker}. You probably won't need to use it yourself,
unless perhaps you come up with an entirely new kind of
L{interfaces.IWorker} implementation.
