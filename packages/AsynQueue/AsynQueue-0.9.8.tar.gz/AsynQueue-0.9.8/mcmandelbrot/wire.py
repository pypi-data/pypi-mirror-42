"""
Uses C{asynqueue.wire} to run and communicate with a server that
generates Mandelbrot Set images.

For the server end, use L{server} to get a Twisted C{service} object
you can start or add to an C{application}.

To communicate with the server, use L{RemoteRunner} to get an
AsynQueue C{Worker} that you can add to your C{TaskQueue}.

Both ends of the connection need to be able to import this module and
reference its L{MandelbrotWorkerUniverse} class.
