Description: # TART: Radio-telescope high-level HTTP interface
        
        This module is used to communicate with the TART radio telescope. It listens on a port on localhost, and
        allows a web-based interface to communicate with the TART hardware.

        ## Running The API Server
        
        The API server is a flask app written in Python. This is run using the 'flask' command line tool on the telescope host (Raspberry Pi)
        that is installed as a dependency of this package. A shell script 'run_api.sh' should be created with the following contents:
        
            #!/bin/bash
            export LOGIN_PW=password
            export FLASK_APP=tart_web_api.main
            flask run
        
        where 'password' is a secure password that can be used to log into the telescope web-application to configure your telescope.
        
        ## Docker
        
        We are now using to deployment using docker. There is a Dockerfile for this in the TART/software/docker/tart_web_api directory.
        
        ## Twisted
        
            twistd -n web --port 8080 --wsgi tart_web_api.app
        
        ## Development work
            
        If you are developing this package, this should be installed using
        
            python3 setyp.py develop
        
        in which case changes to the source-code will be immediately available to projects using it.
