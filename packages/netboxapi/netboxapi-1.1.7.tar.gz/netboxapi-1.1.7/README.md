Python client API for Netbox, using requests.


Usage
-----

Netbox API
==========

Import `NetboxAPI`:

```python
from netboxapi import NetboxAPI
```

Initialize a new `NetboxAPI` object:

```python
netbox_api = NetboxAPI(url="netbox.example.com/api")

# or if you enabled the authentication
netbox_api = NetboxAPI(
    url="netbox.example.com/api", username="user", password="password"
)

# or if you have generated a token
netbox_api = NetboxAPI(
    url="netbox.example.com/api", token="token"
)

# but the following is useless, as the token will not be used
netbox_api = NetboxAPI(
    url="netbox.example.com/api", username="user", password="password",
    token="token"
)
```

Then use multiple available methods to interact with the api:

```python
>>> netbox_api.get("dcim/sites/1/racks/")
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Some rack",
    …
}

>>> netbox_api.post("dcim/device-roles/", json={"name": "test", …},)
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "test",
    …
}

>>> netbox_api.patch("dcim/device-roles/", json={"slug": "test"},)
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "test",
    "slug": "test",
    …
}

>>> netbox_api.put("dcim/device-roles/1/", json={"name": "test", …},)
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "test",
    "slug": "test",
    …
}

>>> netbox_api.delete("dcim/sites/1/")
<<Response [204]>>
```

Netbox Mapper
=============

`NetboxMapper` is available to interact with Netbox objects. Received json from
the netbox API is converted into mapper objects, by setting its attributes
accordingly to the dict. To use it, first import `NetboxMapper`:

```python
from netboxapi import NetboxAPI, NetboxMapper
```

Initialize a new `NetboxMapper` object:

```python
netbox_api = NetboxAPI(
    url="netbox.example.com/api", username="user", password="password"
)
netbox_mapper = NetboxMapper(netbox_api, app_name="dcim", model="sites")
```

### GET

Then get all objects of the model:

```python
>>> sites = list(netbox_mapper.get())
[<NetboxMapper>, <NetboxMapper>, …]

>>> print(sites[0].id)
1
>>> print(sites[0].name)
"Some site"
```

Or get a specific site by its id:

```python
>>> netbox_mapper.get(1)
```

It is possible to get a subresourses of an object, and/or specify a query:

```python
>>> netbox_mapper.get("1", "racks", q="name_to_filter")
```

Any `kwargs` (here `q=`) is used as a GET parameter for the request.

Pagination is transparently handled, but it is possible to specify how many
items are wanted per page by setting the GET parameter `limit`, to limit
the number of requests done to Netbox in case of long iterations.

#### Foreign keys

Foreign keys are handle automatically by the mapper.

```python
>>> site = next(netbox_mapper.get())
>>> print(site.region.name)
"Some region"
```

When accessing to `site.region`, a query will be done to fetch the foreign
object. It will then be saved in cache to avoid unnecessary queries for next
accesses.

To refresh an object and its foreign keys, just do:

```python
>>> site = next(site.get())
```

### POST

Use the `kwargs` of a mapper to send a post request and create a new object:

```python
>>> netbox_mapper.post(name="A site", slug="a_site", region="Some region")
<NetboxMapper>  # corresponding to the new created object
```

If a mapper is sent as parameter, `post()` will automatically take its id.
However, it will not update the foreign object.

### PUT

Use `put()` in a child mapper to update the resource upstream by reflecting
the changes made in the object attributes:

```python
>>> child_mapper = netbox_mapper.get(1)
>>> child_mapper.name = "another name"
>>> child_mapper.put()
<requests>  # requests object containing the netbox response
```

### PATCH

`PATCH` is not supported in mappers, as it does not make really sense (to me)
with the mapper logic.

### DELETE

Delete an object upstream by calling `delete()`:

```python
>>> netbox_mapper.delete(1)
<requests>  # requests object containing the netbox response

# OR

>>> child_mapper = netbox_mapper.get(1)
>>> child_mapper.delete()
<requests>  # requests object containing the netbox response
```

But trying to delete another object of the same model from a child mapper is
not possible:

```python
>>> child_mapper = netbox_mapper.get(1)
>>> child_mapper.delete(2)
Exception ForbiddenAsChildError
```

------------
  * python 3.4 (it certainly works with prior versions, just not tested)
