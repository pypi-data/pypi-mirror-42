Description: About
        =====
        
        Based on: `Dowser <http://www.aminus.net/wiki/Dowser>`__
        
        A Django specific Dowser port.
        
        Following enhancements have been implemented on top of the original Dowser:
        
        -  long term historical analysis: 1m, 1h, 1d, 4w buffers
        -  optimization by moving from lists to python deque
        -  server load optimization by moving charts to google chart
        -  only superuser can view the analysis (Django specific)

        Future
        ======
        - move charts to javascript
        - move inline html to templates
        - drop Django 1.x and Python 2.x compatibility
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            # latest release
            pip install django-dowser
            # or latest master
            pip install git+git://github.com/munhitsu/django-dowser.git
        
        Next, modify project configuration.
        
        settings.py
        -----------
        
        ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += ['django_dowser']
        
        urls.py
        -------
        
        ::
        
            from django.urls import path, include
            urlpatterns += [url(r'^dowser/', include('django_dowser.urls'))]
        
        
        Note
        ----
        
        Use django-dowser only on multithreaded/gevent servers. With forking, or multiple servers, each process
        will have it's own Dowser storage, so you will only get a glimpse into one process and further requests may be load
        balanced to the other servers.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Start the project and open link:
        
        ::
        
            http://domain/dowser/
        
        When running in the local development mode, it is usually:
        
        ::
        
            http://127.0.0.1:8000/dowser/
