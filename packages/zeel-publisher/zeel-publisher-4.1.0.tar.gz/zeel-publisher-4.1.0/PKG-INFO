Description: # Zeel Publisher
        
        A Library meant to standardize the way zapi services interact with SNS/SQS.
        
        # Getting Started
        
        ## Docker
        
        The infrastructure of this library is designed to be run inside of various
        docker containers. Specifically there is a container for:
        - The python environment the library's code runs in
        - A jaeger tracing instance
        - The localstack AWS simulator
        
        These containers can be viewed inside the project's docker-compose.yml
        
        Because these containers are all needed to create a functioning local
        environment, proceeding without docker is NOT recommended. It can be installed
        using the docker for mac installer or via
        
        `brew cask install docker`
        
        ## The pipenv Virtual Environment
        
        This service's dependencies are all managed with
        [https://github.com/pypa/pipenv](pipenv) and are enumerated inside the project's
        Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files. Pipenv is a superset of Pip, and will create a
        virtual python environment (the .venv folder) for this Service. To that end,
        please ensure you have pipenv installed on your local machine.
        
        `brew install pipenv`
        
        ### Configuring your Virtual Environment
        
        To create a virtual environment (the .venv directory) inside your project folder
        instead of your home (~) directory, save the following in your .bash_profile or .zshrc:
        
        `export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1`
        
        This is highly recommended for vscode users, as the project's linters and
        formatters are configured to use binaries installed to a local .venv
        
        ### Running the Library's tests on Docker
        
        Although tests can be run locally, it is recommended to run them through docker,
        where they will have access to the infrastructure they need. To do so you can
        use this command:
        
        `docker-compose run publisher-app bash test.sh`
        
        # Modules
        
        ## Event Publisher
        
        A Class meant for publishing Event Messages to a single SNS topic.
        
        # Distribution
        
        This Code is meant for distribution across multiple projects, namely our various
        zapi services which require zeel-publisher as a dependency. The library itself
        is hosted on PyPi and can be found at
        
        https://pypi.org/project/zeel-publisher/
        
        ## Versioning
        
        Zeel publisher versioning follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) syntax:
        
        `Major.Minor.Patch`
        
        Make sure to update setup.py accordingly before publishing a new version.
        
        ## Commands for uploading to PyPi
        
        Create build - `pipenv run python3 setup.py sdist`
        Publish - `pipenv run twine upload dist/*`
