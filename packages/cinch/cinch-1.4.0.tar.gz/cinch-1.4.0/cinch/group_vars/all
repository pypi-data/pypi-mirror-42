# Override default distro NTP server configuration
# Define the var ntp_servers as below to optionally override default NTP
# server lines, including options such as iburst.
# Left undefined, the distro defaults will be used.
#ntp_servers:
#    - "server 0.time.example.com iburst"
#    - "server 1.time.example.com iburst"
#    - "server 2.time.example.com iburst"
#    - "server 3.time.example.com iburst"

# Override these variables with an array of files to be uploaded as-is to the
# destination host. Files in pre_upload_files will be uploaded before any other
# code is run. Files in post_upload_files will be uploaded after all other tasks
# have been run. Each element in the array must contain an object with the
# following fields:
# src (required): the local path to the file to upload
# dest (required): the remote path to upload the file into
# owner (optional): the user who will own the file after upload
# group (optional): the group to set on the file after upload
# mode (optional): the mode to set on the uploaded file
# For more information or clarification on these variables, refer to the Ansible
# module documentation for the "copy" module. Variables in this array match
# the arguments to that module of the same name.
# http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/copy_module.html
# NOTE: Variables are not defined here, as the playbook group_vars/all file overrides
# variables in the inventory file's group vars section (although they do not override
# variables in the inventory dir's group_vars folder).
# Example
# pre_upload_files:
#   - src: /home/deployuser/somehost/ssl.key
#     dest: /etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.key
#     mode: 0600
# post_upload_files:
#   - src: /home/deployuser/somehost/id_rsa
#     dest: /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa
#     owner: jenkins
#     mode: 0600
