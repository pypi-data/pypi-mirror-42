# if you want a different set of repositories than this package installs by default.
# It is not recommended that you touch the "repositories" variable in your
# variables, as that value is set to include repositories that are necessary for
# master and slave software installation. extra_repositories is unused by this
# software and is designed to be overridden by the user with any extra repositories
# they want added to the host.

# Override with an array of strings that are URLs to repository files, if you want
# them downloaded into the target /etc/yum.repos.d/ folder so that they can be
# added to the package repositories

# Override this with a list of objects matching the pattern
# - key: <some_path_to_key>
#   validate_certs: <true|false>
# The path to a key should point towards a valid GPG key, this can either be local
# to the system or a remote URL that can be accessed and downloaded.
# The validate_certs parameter can be set to "false" if the key is hosted at an SSL
# based URL for which the system does not have certificate authorities installed.
# Generally this should be set to "true" and the SSL certificiates should be imported
# using the certificate_authority role. This parameter will have no effect on paths
# to local files.
#
# Use this variable to import GPG keys for RPM repositories that are installed but
# which do not have keys which can be auto imported but still sign their RPMs and
# you do not want to override the verification behavior
