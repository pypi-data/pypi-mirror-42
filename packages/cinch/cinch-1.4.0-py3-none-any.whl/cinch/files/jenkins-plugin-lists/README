All files in this directory ending in .txt will be newline-separated lists of
Jenkins plugins.  These files will be read by our update center build job as
well as the CI Provisioner for determining what list of plugins to build or
install.  Each file is named based on the update center ID.  If your update
center ID is 'redhat' then the file name should be 'redhat.txt'.
