Description: # Blog flask extension
        
        This extension allows you to add a simple blog frontend to your flask app. All the articles
        are pulled from the WordPress API that has the plugin WP-JSON.
        
        This extension provides a blueprint with 3 routes:
        - "/": that returns the list of articles
        - "/<slug>": the article page
        - "/feed": provides a RSS feed for the page.
        
        ## How to use
        
        In your app you can:
        
            import canonicalwebteam.Flask_Blog import BlogExtension
            blog = BlogExtension(app, "Blog title", [1], "tag_name", "/url-prefix")
        
        If you use the factory pattern you can also:
        
            import canonicalwebteam.Flask_Blog import BlogExtension
            blog = BlogExtension()
            blog.init_app(app, "Blog title", [1], "tag_name", "/url-prefix")
