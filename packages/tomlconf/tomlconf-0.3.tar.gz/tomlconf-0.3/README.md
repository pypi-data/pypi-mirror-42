# TOML Conf

_The tiny TOML configuration tool._



Write less code and spend your time on what matters most, not the boring configuration:

* Plug it in and go; works out of the box.
* Exception handling best practices.
* Simple and easy-to-read; PEP8 compliant.
* Tested POSIX support.
* Cross-platform per-user config file locations.



Built on TOML Kit:

* A fast, 0.5.0-compliant TOML parser.
* Preserves the layout, style, and the order of configuration data.
