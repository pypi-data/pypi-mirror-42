Description: # python-smarthab
        This Python library allows you to programmatically control your SmartHab-powered
        home.
        
        ## What is SmartHab?
        [SmartHab](http://www.smarthab.fr) is a company that installs their home 
        automation solution in new buildings, and offers a mobile application for 
        home owners or renters to control their home over the Internet.
        
            Mobile App -> API -> SmartHab box (1 at each floor) -> Z-Wave devices
        
        ## What is this?
        `python-smarthab` connects to the SmartHab API and allows you to automate your
        home without having to use the mobile application.
        
        It might prove particularly useful if integrated into a home automation box or
        software. Feel free to use it, it's under the GPL!
