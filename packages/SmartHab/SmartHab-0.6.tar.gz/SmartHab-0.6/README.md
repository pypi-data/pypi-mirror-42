# python-smarthab
This Python library allows you to programmatically control your SmartHab-powered
home.

## What is SmartHab?
[SmartHab](http://www.smarthab.fr) is a company that installs their home 
automation solution in new buildings, and offers a mobile application for 
home owners or renters to control their home over the Internet.

    Mobile App -> API -> SmartHab box (1 at each floor) -> Z-Wave devices

## What is this?
`python-smarthab` connects to the SmartHab API and allows you to automate your
home without having to use the mobile application.

It might prove particularly useful if integrated into a home automation box or
software. Feel free to use it, it's under the GPL!
