        The CiS framework, yggdrasil, provides support for combining scientific models
        written in different programming languages. To combine two models,
        modelers add simple communications interfaces to the model code and
        provide simple declarative specification files that identify the models
        that should be run and the inputs and outputs those models expect.
        
        The system uses the specification files to configure the communications
        channels and expose them to the models. The complexity of the particular
        communications system is managed by the framework, which performs
        communication setup, binds the communications to simple interfaces
        within the models, and manages execution of the models. The complexities
        of model registration and discovery, as well as the complexities of
        setup and management of the communications system are handled
        under-the-hood by the framework under direction of the model
        specification, freeing the domain scientist from implementing
        communications protocols or translating models to the same programming
        language.
