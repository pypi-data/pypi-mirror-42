        # installation
        - Archlinux: PKGBUILD in AUR
        - PIP: sudo pip install fenrir-screenreader
        - Manual:
         - install "espeak" and "sox" with your package manager
         - sudo pip install -r requirements.txt 
         - run install.sh and uninstall.sh as root
        - you also can just run it from Git without installing:
        You can just run the following as root:
        if you are in Fenrir Git rootfolder:
        cd src/fenrir/
        sudo ./fenrir
        Settings "settings.conf" is located in the "config" directory or after installation in /etc/fenrir/settings.
        Take care to use drivers from the config matching your installed drivers. 
        By default it uses:
        - sound driver: genericDriver (via sox, could configured in settings.conf)
        - speech driver: genericDriver (via espeak or espeak-ng, could configured in settings.conf)
        - braille driver: brlttyDriver (WIP)
        - input driver: evdevDriver
