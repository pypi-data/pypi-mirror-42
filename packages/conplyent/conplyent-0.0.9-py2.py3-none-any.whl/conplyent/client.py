    local pool to allow for creation of many clients. This creates a class
    :class:`client.ClientConnection` which will allow users to communicate
    with the server existing on a different process (local or remote).

    This does not establish the connection.

class ClientConnection():
    '''
    Client connection class that provides the means to connect to a local or
    remote server and execute commands. These commands are defined in the
    :module:`server`. This class will request to sync methods with the remote
    server which will provide all available methods. Users using the
    ClientConnection class can easily send commands over to the remote server as
    if just calling class methods.

    :Example:

    >>> from conplyent import client
    >>> my_conn = client.add_client("localhost")
    >>> my_conn.connect()
    >>> my_conn.ls()

    These methods are not initially defined in the client class so the
    Connection will not be able to provide the methods intiially. Attempting to
    run commands at this point will result in AttributeError.

    Once the connection has been established, users can use
    :meth:`client.ClientConnection.server_methods` to view all of the commands.
    This method does not provide any keyword parameters though. May look into
    doing so in the future. When using these commands, users can access the
    server methods using any args or kwargs combination as defined in the server
    methods. These methods will have the same requirements as defined in the
    server. I.e. order sent to server is the order defined in the server
    methods. And the kwargs follow the same name:value format as the server.

    Both of these are valid:

    >>> my_conn.cd("..")
    >>> my_conn.cd(dest="..")

    Any errors resulted by user input will be passed back to the client. These
    will not crash the server. For example, if we pass in an int to 'cd'
    command, this command will output the complete traceback provided by the
    server.

    :cd(1):

    >>> TypeError('chdir: path should be string, bytes or os.PathLike, not int')

    When using these server methods, users can provide three additional kwargs
    to the method that are processed client side. These are "timeout",
    "complete", and "echo_response".

    Timeout defines the amount of time that we want to wait for the send command
    to go through. This could come into play for scenarios where you have a
    bunch of network activity on the host so that send command may take a while
    to go through ZMQ. By default timeout is None, so the send will be
    guaranteed to go through (though no promises on how long it may take). On a
    typical system where you have a more relaxed network activity, this send
    should go through immedaitely.

    Complete can be disabled to have more control over how the this class
    receives outputs from the server. If complete is set to True (as is
    default), once the command has been sent, this class will continually
    attempt to receives the output from the server and append to a list that is
    returned. If complete is set to False, these methods will return a
    :class:`client.ClientConnection.ClientListener` instance which the user can
    use themselves to listen to the output in real time. This is mostly useful
    when we are running background tasks. These tasks will still continue to be
    executed in the server but we don't need to wait for it. Examples of use
    cases: If we need to send input to the task, if we want to kill it
    prematurely, or if we want to parse and process the output in real time.
    See description of jobs for more information.

    :complete=False:

    >>> listener = my_conn.exec("some_long_command", complete=False)
    >>> ... do something else ...
    >>> for response in iter(listener.next, None):
    >>>     ... do something with response ...

    Echo Response will simply print to stdout the response in real time. This
    can be useful when users have enabled complete.
