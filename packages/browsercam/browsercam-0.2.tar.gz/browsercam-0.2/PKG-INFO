Description: # browsercam
        
        This module was built for Chromebooks running Crostini, which currently
        don't have access to the webcam module. Using browsercam is simple:
        
        ```python
        import browsercam
        
        def process_image(image):
            size = len(image)
            print('Captured image is {} bytes'.format(isize))
        
        webcam = browsercam.Webcam()
        webcam.on_capture(process_image)
        webcam.start()
        ```
