Description: Provides different shortcuts functions (helpers) for humanity.
        
        Created to be something like Ramda or Lodash for Python, but without
        functional style.
        
        
        For strings:
        
        `reverse` - Reverse a string.
        `replace` -
        	Replaces one substring in string to another.
        	Analog to string method with same name,
        	but also adds ability to change direction, from which to replace substring.
        
        
        For collections:
        
        `get` - Returns or element from collection by index (key), or None if not found.
        
        
        For asyncio:
        
        `run_async` - Asynchronously runs coroutine (function, defind with 'async def') until it completes.
