        **Insallation instructions**
        
        ```
        pip install rfinder
        ```
        
        To create a local repository, type:

        ```
        
        ***
        
        **Requisites**
        
        For a successfull installation make sure to have installed the following packages.
        
        - RFInder makes use of the most common `python` packages (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `astropy`). 
        - The parameter file is in `yaml` format, hence [`pyaml`](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pyyaml), and [`json`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/json-c) packages should be installed,
        - The `logging` module is used to print out warnings.
        - `.gif` file of multiple plots can be created if `ffmpeg` is installed.
        - `casacore` is utilized to open casa tables.
        - `texmaker` to plot latex fancy formulae
        - `dvipng`
        - `python tk`

        **Description**
        
        This is a set of tools that have been developed in preparation of the Apertif & MeerKAT surveys.
        
        The main function of `rfinder` is to identify the presence of RFI in an observation and visualize it according to different parameters.
        
        These are the available functions:
        
        - visualize the presence of RFI per frequency channel and baseline length.
        - visualize the percentage flagged visibilities due to RFI per frequency channel. 
        - visualize the increase in noice due to RFI per frequency channel.
        - estimate the shape of the PSF after flagging of RFI.
        
        check out the [WiKi](https://github.com/Fil8/RFInder/wiki) for a complete illustration of `RFInder`.
        
        ***
        **Usage**
        
        `rfinder rfinder_default.yml`
        
        Commands and options of `RFInder` are specified in the yaml file
        
        These [tutorials](https://github.com/Fil8/RFInder/tree/master/tutorials) show the different capabilities of `rfinder`.
