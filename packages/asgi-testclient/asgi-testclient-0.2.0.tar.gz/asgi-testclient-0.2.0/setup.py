Well, because mostly all those web frameworks have to build their own. I was building my own web framework perhaps (research & learning purpose) and got to the point where a needed a `TestClient` but then a asked my self **why does anybody building web frameworks have to build their own TestClient when there\'s a standard?**. Ok, then just install `starlette` a use it test client; would you install a library just to use a tiny part of it? **This client does not have any dependencies**.\n\n## Requirements\n\n`Python 3.6+`\n\nIt should run on Python 3.5 but I haven\' tested it.\n\n## Installation\n\n`pip install asgi-testclient`\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThe client replicates the requests API, so if you have used request you should feel comfortable. **Note:** the client method are coroutines `get, post, delete, put, patch, etc..`.\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom asgi_testclient import TestClient\n\nfrom myapp import API\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef client():\n    return TestClient(API)\n\n@pytest.mark.asyncio\nasync def test_get(client):\n    response = await client.get("/")\n    assert response.json() == {"hello": "world"}\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n```\n\nI have used `pytest` in this example but you can use whichever runner you prefer.\n\nIf you still prefer simple functions to coroutines, you can use the sync interface:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom asgi_testclient.sync import TestClient\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef client():\n    return TestClient(API)\n\ndef test_get(client):\n    response = client.get("/")\n    assert response.json() == {"hello": "world"}\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n```\n\n**Take in account that if you\'re running inside an async app you should use the async client, yet you can run the sync one inside threads is still desired.**\n\n## TODO:\n- [ ] Support Websockets client.\n- [ ] Cookies support.\n- [ ] Redirects.\n- [ ] Support files encoding\n- [ ] Stream request & response\n\n\n## Credits\n\n- `Tom Christie`: I brought inspiration from the `starlette` test client.\n- `Kenneth â˜¤ Reitz`: This package tries to replicate `requests` API.',
