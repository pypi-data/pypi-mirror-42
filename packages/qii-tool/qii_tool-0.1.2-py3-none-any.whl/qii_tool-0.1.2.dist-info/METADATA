Quantitative Input Influence - an influence measures for Algorithmic Transparency

The `qii_tool` package is an implementation of the QII method proposed in the paper ["Algorithmic Transparency via Quantitative Input Influence: Theory and Experiments with Learning Systems"](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~zick/papers/transparency.oakland16.pdf). The original paper discusses the transparency-privacy tradeoff, whereas this particular package only exploits its transparency aspect to be used as an influence measures - an instance of interpretable machine learning.

Install `qii_tool` on your system using:
```python
pip install qii_tool
```
