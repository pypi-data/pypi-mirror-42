Description: # rpi-cam-mqtt-client
        
        Client library to control a raspberry PI camera through MQTT.
        
        Provides high level methods to control a raspberry PI camera:
          - get_cmd_list
          - get_cmd_info
          - run_command
          - get_status
          - get_ptviews
          - is_active
          - is_ptview_available
          - is_recording
          - is_detecting_motion
          - set_camera_status
          - set_motion_detection_status
          - start_video
          - stop_video
          - take_picture
          - set_exposure_mode
          - set_wb_mode
          - set_metering_mode
          - set_image_effect
          - set_pantilt
        
        The camera needs to have the RPi-Cam-Web-Interface installed and the MQTT agent running. Check `rpi-cam-mqtt` (https://gitlab.com/gbus/rpi-cam-mqtt) project for further details.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The library can be installed and called in a python module:
        
            pip3 install rpicammqtt_client
        
            from rpicammqtt_client import RpiCamMqttClient
            help(RpiCamMqttClient)
        
        ## Configuration
        
        The configuration file is looked up from:
        
            /etc/rpi-cam-mqtt/rpi-cam-mqtt.yaml
            $HOME/.rpi-cam-mqtt/rpi-cam-mqtt.yaml
            ./config/rpi-cam-mqtt.yaml
        
        A template can be downloaded from:
        
            https://gitlab.com/gbus/rpi-cam-mqtt-client/raw/master/rpicammqtt_client/config/rpi-cam-mqtt.yaml
             
        
        ## Use
        
        The main class RpiCamMqttClient needs to have passed a reference to publish/subscribe custom definitions to implement the specific calls to the MQTT library of choice.
        One based on the paho mqtt library is provided and can be used for reference:
        
            from rpicammqtt_client import RpiCamMqttClient
            from rpicammqtt_client.mqtt import MQTT
        
        
        The RpiCamMqttClient needs the `rpicam` name as configured in the remote agent that controls the camera and a few extra options to change the MQTT behaviour.
        
        The main method to use is `run_command`, which allows to publish any command as it would normally be sent to the PIPE. More info:
        
            https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface#Pipe
            
        Additionally a few higher level methods are provided that simplify the use of the library.
        A good starting point is the list of examples described in the next section where it is possible to see the library in action. 
        
        
        ## Applications
        
        Example of applications using the library can be found in the package:
