Description: # shutilwhich-cwdpatch
        
        Patch for `shutil.which` and `shutilwhich` that doesn't prepend CWD in search on Windows.
        
        
        # Install
        
        ```bash
        conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge shutilwhich-cwdpatch
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        pip install shutilwhich-cwdpatch
        ```
        
        
        # Usage:
        
        Simply import `patch` submodule before importing `shutil.which` or `shutilwhich` to patch them:
        
        ```py
        import shutilwhich_cwdpatch.patch
        from shutil import which
        ```
        
        Or use `which` without patching:
        
        ```py
        from shutilwhich_cwdpatch import which
        ```
