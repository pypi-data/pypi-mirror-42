Bayesian Cut Package
====================

The Bayesian Cut Python package provides an easy to use API for the straight-forward application of Bayesian network
cuts using a full Bayesian inference framework based on the Gibbs-Sampler using the degree corrected Stochastic
Blockmodel (dc-SBM) or the Bayesian Cut (BC).
Furthermore it provides modularity, ratio-cut and norm cut based spectral network cut methods.
It also provides a rich visualization library that allow an easy analysis of posterior solution landscapes and network
cuts obtained by the various methods.
