# MCMole3D
Monte-Carlo MOlecular Line Emission MCMOLE3D is a python package which simulates the 3D  molecular cloud emission in the Milky Way. In particular, it can simulate both  the unpolarized and polarized emission coming from the   first rotational line of Carbon Monoxide (CO, `J=1-0`).

Package  documentation: [MCMOle3D doc]( http://giuspugl.github.io/mcmole/index.html ). You can find also a  [Tutorial] ( https://github.com/giuspugl/MCMole3D/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md ) 

`MCMole3D` simulations have been used for the results in   [Puglisi et al 2017](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07856)
