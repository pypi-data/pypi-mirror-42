# TODO: This function could be made a bit more general
def get_clusters(atoms, cutoffs, nPrim, multiplicity=True,
                 use_geometrical_order=False):
    """Generate a list of all clusters in the atoms object which includes the
    center atoms with positions within the cell metric. The cutoff determines
    up to which order and range clusters should be generated.

    With multiplicity set to True clusters like `[0,0]` and `[3,3,4` etc will
    be generated. This is useful when doing force constants but not so much for
    cluster expansions.

    The geometrical order is the total number of different atoms in the
    cluster. `[0,0,1]` would have geometrical order 2 and `[1,2,3,4]` would
    have order 4. If the key word is True the cutoff criteria will be based on
    the geometrical order of the cluster. This is based on the observation that
    many body interactions decrease fast with cutoff but anharmonic
    interactions can be quite long ranged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : ase.Atoms
        can be a general atoms object but must have pbc=False.
    cutoffs : dict
        the keys specify the order while the values specify the cutoff radii
    multiplicity : bool
        includes clusters where same atom appears more than once
    geometrical_order : bool
        specifies if the geometrical order should be used as cutoff_order,
        otherwise the normal order of the cluster is used

    Returns
    -------
    list(tuple(int))
        a list of clusters where each entry is a tuple of indices,
        which refer to the atoms in the input supercell
