Description: 
        Fattoush
        ========
        
        Fattoush is a package that combines lettuce, webdriver and sauce to make
        a tasty UI testing salad.
        
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Fattoush provides its own test runner which invokes lettuce such that it
        runs in saucelabs, with support of parallel test runs.
        
            $ fattoush --parallel=webdriver
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Just write your lettuce tests as normal,
        but in your terrain file add
        
            from fattoush import hooks
        
        You will now find that in each step you are able to add
        
            from fattoush import Driver
        
        This returns a subclass of WebDriver with a class method `instance()`
        which takes the current step or feature and returns the active WebDriver
        instance.
