Workflow Manager
================

This package provides a GUI for creating and editing custom workflows in Plone.

Version 1.x is the original GUI, similar to what you would see in the Management Interface.

Version 2.x presents the workflow in the form of an interactive workflow diagram.
This YouTube video shows how the diagram-centric UI works in workflow manager 2.x:
