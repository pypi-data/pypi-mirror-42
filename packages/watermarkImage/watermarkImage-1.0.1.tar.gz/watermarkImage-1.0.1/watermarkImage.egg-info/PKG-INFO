Description: # Welcome to Watermark Image!
        
        
        The package will let you watermark batch of images.
        This package is written in python 3.5.4
        
        You have 3 methods you can use:
        
        ### Installation
        
        
        
        You can install the watermark-image from PyPI:
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install watermarkImage
        ```
        
        You have 3 methods you can use:
        
        1. watermarkDir:
        
            **input:**
            
                - dirToSearch: path to folder with all the images you want to watermark.
                - logo: PIL image object.
                - Position: one of 4 corners - please use Position enum from the package!
                - Opacity: opacity of logo (1-10), the default is 5.
                - Logo size: there are 4 sizes to choose, the default is 2. 
            
            The output is list of PIL images.
        
        2. watermarkList:
        
            Same like watermarkDir but instead of "dirToSearch" there is "listOfImages" - list of PIL images.
            The output is the same.
            
        3. saveImages:
        
            **input**
                
                - listOfImages: list of PIL images.
                - pathToSave: path to save the watermark images (the folder will be created if not exists).
                
        
        Note that the package supports only jpg\png
