Remove any locking.

The database is locked to allow fast loading of data which requires no other command access the database.
Using this command removes the lock and so MAY CAUSE DATA CORRUPTION if the loading is still in progress.

You should only use this command in the unlikely case that somehow the lock remained after the loading finished
(eg. if the system crashed or was interrupted during loading).

    with db.session_context() as s:
        SystemConstant.reset_lock(s)
