Description: spiops
        ======
        
        spiops is a library aimed to help scientists and engineers that deal with 
        Solar System Geometry mainly for planetary science. More in particular is 
        aimed to assists the users to extend the usage of SPICE.
        
        SPICE is an essential tool for scientists and engineers alike in the 
        planetary science field for Solar System Geometry. Please visit the NAIF 
        website  for more details about SPICE.
         
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        spiops is a python library thar uses [SpiceyPy](https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy) to use [SPICE Toolkit](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/>) APIS to provide higher-level functions than the ones available 
        with SPICE. This functions have been idenfitied from having to implement 
        multiple time a series of SPICE APIs to obtain a given derived functionality.
        
        Functionalities vary from the computation of the illumination of a given 
        Field-of-View to obtaining the coverage of a given S/C for a particular 
        meta-kernel.
        
        The underlying idea of spiops is to be used as a multi-user and 
        multi-disciplinary pool of re-usable SPICE based functions to provide cross 
        mission and discipline support of SPICE for ESA Planetary and Heliophyiscs 
        missions. 
        
        spiops is developed and maintained by the [ESA SPICE Service (ESS)](https://spice.esac.esa.int).
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First install the dependencies (spiceypy, pytest) for the project. Then
        run ``pip install spiops`` to install from pypi.
        
        If you wish to install spiceypy from source first download or clone the project. Then run ``python setup.py install``.
        To uninstall run ``pip uninstall spiceypy``.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The spiops docs are available [here](ftp://spiftp.esac.esa.int/spiops/html/index.html).
        The documentation for spiops is intentionally abridged so as to utilize the 
        excellent [documentation provided by the
        NAIF](http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/index.html).
        Please refer to C and IDL documentation available on the NAIF website
        for in-depth explanations. Most of the functions docstrings have a 
        link to the
        corresponding C function in the NAIF docs that the function is based on.
        
        How to Help
        -----------
        
        Feedback and new functionalities are always welcome, if you discover that a 
        function is not 
        working as expected or if you have a function that you believe can be of 
        interest to other people please open an issue or contact [me](marc.costa@esa.int).
        
        Citing spiops
        --------------
        
        If the use of spiops is used in a publication, please consider
        citing spiops, SpiceyPy and the SPICE toolkit. The citation information
        for SPICE can be found on the NAIF website and the citation information for 
        SpiceyPy in the GitHub repository.
        
        
        
        Known Working Environments:
        ---------------------------
        
        spiops is compatible with modern Linux and Mac. At this development stage and
        with the available resources is hard to guarantee an extension of the 
        compatible working environments. If you run into issues with your system 
        please submit an issue with details. 
        
        - OS: OS X, Linux
        - CPU: 64bit
        - Python 3.5
        
        Acknowledgements
        ----------------
        
        spiops makes an intensive usage of SpiceyPy, a Python wrapper for the 
        NAIF C SPICE Toolkit (N66) by [AndrewAnnex](https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/).
        
        We have to be very grateful to Andrew for having brought SPICE to Python!
