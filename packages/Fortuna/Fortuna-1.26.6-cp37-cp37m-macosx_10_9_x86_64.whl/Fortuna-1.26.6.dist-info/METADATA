# Fortuna: Fast & Flexible Random Value Generators
Fortuna replaces much of the functionality of Python's Random module, often achieving 10x better performance. However, the most interesting bits of Fortuna are found in the high-level abstractions like FlexCat, QuantumMonty and TruffleShuffle.

The core functionality of Fortuna is based on the Mersenne Twister Algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto (松本 眞) and Takuji Nishimura (西村 拓士). Fortuna is not appropriate for cryptography of any kind. Fortuna is for games, data science, AI and experimental programming, not security.

The Fortuna generator was designed to use hardware seeding exclusively. This allows the generator to be completely encapsulated.

Installation: `$ pip install Fortuna` or you can download and build from source. Building Fortuna requires the latest version of Python3, Cython, python3 dev tools, and a modern C++17 compiler. Fortuna is designed, built and tested for MacOS X, and also happens to work with many flavors of Linux. Fortuna is not officially supported on Windows at this time.

Fortuna is built for the default CPython implementation standard, other implementations may or may not support c-extensions like Fortuna. A pure Python version of Fortuna is included in the extras folder. The Fortuna c-extension is roughly an order of magnitude faster than the pure Python version, but they offer the same API and functionality.

## Fortuna Random Functions
### Random Numbers
`Fortuna.random_range(lo: int, hi: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [lo..hi] inclusive. Up to 15x faster than `random.randint()`. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.random_below(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the exclusive range [0..num) for positive values of num. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.d(sides: int) -> int`. Represents a single die roll of a given size die. Returns a random integer in the range [1..sides]. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.dice(rolls: int, sides: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [X..Y] where X = rolls and Y = rolls * sides. The return value represents the sum of multiple rolls of the same size die. Geometric distribution based on the number and size of the dice rolled. Complexity scales primarily with the number of rolls, not the size of the dice.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus(num: int) -> int`. Negative and positive input values of num will produce equivalent distributions. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_linear(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Zero peak geometric distribution, up triangle.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_curve(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the bounded range [-num..num]. Zero peak gaussian distribution, bounded stretched bell curve: mean = 0, variance = num / pi.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_linear_down(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [-num..num]. Edge peak geometric distribution, down triangle. Inverted plus_or_minus_linear.

`Fortuna.plus_or_minus_curve_down(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in the range [-num..num]. Edge peak gaussian distribution, upside down bell curve. Inverted plus_or_minus_curve.

`Fortuna.zero_flat(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Flat uniform distribution.

`Fortuna.zero_cool(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Zero peak, geometric distribution, lefthand triangle.

`Fortuna.zero_extreme(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Zero peak, gaussian distribution, half bell curve.

`Fortuna.max_cool(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Max peak (num), geometric distribution, righthand triangle.

`Fortuna.max_extreme(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Max peak (num), gaussian distribution, half bell curve.

`Fortuna.mostly_middle(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Middle peak (num / 2), geometric distribution, up triangle. Ranges that span an even number of values will have two dominant values in the middle rather than one, this will guarantee that the probability distribution is always symmetrical.

`Fortuna.mostly_center(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Middle peak (num / 2), gaussian distribution, bell curve: mean = num / 2, variance = num / pi.

`Fortuna.mostly_not_middle(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Edge peaks, geometric distribution, down triangle. Ranges that span an even number of values will have two dominant values in the middle rather than one, this will guarantee that the probability distribution is always symmetrical.

`Fortuna.mostly_not_center(num: int) -> int`. Returns a random integer in range [0..num]. Edge peaks, gaussian distribution, upside down bell curve.

`Fortuna.random_float() -> float`. Returns a random float in range [0.0..1.0) exclusive. Same as random.random().


### Random Truth
`Fortuna.percent_true(num: int) -> bool`. Always returns False if num is 0 or less, always returns True if num is 100 or more. Any value of num in range [1..99] will produce True or False based on the value of num - the probability of True as a percentage.

`Fortuna.percent_true_float(num: float) -> bool`. Always returns False if num is 0.0 or less, always returns True if num is 100.0 or more. It will produce True or False based on the value of num - the probability of True as a percentage. Same as percent_true but with floating point accuracy.


### Random Sequence Values
`Fortuna.random_value(arr) -> value`. Returns a random value from a sequence (list or tuple), uniform distribution, non-destructive. Up to 10x faster than random.choice().

`Fortuna.pop_random_value(arr: list) -> value`. Returns and removes a random value from a sequence list, uniform distribution, destructive. Not included in the test suite due to it's destructive nature. This is the only destructive function in the module, use with care. It will raise an error if the list is empty.

`Fortuna.shuffle(arr: list) -> None`. Alternate Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm. More than an order of magnitude faster than random.shuffle().


### Random Table Values
`Fortuna.cumulative_weighted_choice(table) -> value`. Core function for the WeightedChoice base class. Produces a custom distribution of values based on cumulative weights. Requires input format: `[(weight, value), ... ]` sorted in ascending order by weight. Weights must be unique positive integers. See WeightedChoice class for a more comprehensive solution that verifies and optimizes the table. Up to 15x faster than random.choices()


## Fortuna Random Classes
### Sequence Wrappers
#### Truffle Shuffle
Returns a random value from the wrapped sequence.

Produces a uniform distribution with a wide spread. Longer sequences will naturally push duplicates even farther apart. This behavior gives rise to output sequences that seem less mechanical than other random sequences.

Flatten: TruffleShuffle will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True. A callable object is any function, method or lambda.

- Constructor takes a copy of a sequence (generator, list or tuple) of arbitrary values.
- Values can be any Python object that can be passed around.
- Features continuous smart micro-shuffling: The Truffle Shuffle.
- Performance scales by some small fraction of the length of the input sequence.

```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


truffle_shuffle = TruffleShuffle(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])
truffle_shuffle()  # returns a random value, cycled uniform distribution.
```


#### The Quantum Monty
QuantumMonty is a set of strategies for producing random values from a sequence where the probability of each value is based on the method or "monty" you choose. For example: the mostly_front monty produces random values where the beginning of the sequence is geometrically more common than the back. This always produces a 45 degree slope down no matter how many values are in the data.

The Quantum Monty Algorithm is special, it produces values by overlapping the probability waves of six of the other methods. The distribution it produces is a gentle curve up towards the middle with a distinct bump in the center of the sequence.

Flatten: QuantumMonty will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are not called. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

- Constructor takes a copy of a sequence (generator, list or tuple) of arbitrary values.
- Sequence length must be greater than three, best if ten or more.
- Values can be any Python object that can be passed around... string, int, list, function etc.
- Performance scales by some tiny fraction of the length of the sequence. Method scaling may vary slightly.

```python
from Fortuna import QuantumMonty


quantum_monty = QuantumMonty(["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"])

# Each of the following methods will return a random value from the sequence.
quantum_monty.mostly_front()        # Mostly from the front of the list (geometric descending)
quantum_monty.mostly_middle()       # Mostly from the middle of the list (geometric pyramid)
quantum_monty.mostly_back()         # Mostly from the back of the list (geometric ascending)
quantum_monty.mostly_first()        # Mostly from the very front of the list (stretched gaussian descending)
quantum_monty.mostly_center()       # Mostly from the very center of the list (stretched gaussian bell curve)
quantum_monty.mostly_last()         # Mostly from the very back of the list (stretched gaussian ascending)
quantum_monty.quantum_monty()       # Quantum Monty Algorithm. Overlapping probability waves.
quantum_monty.mostly_flat()         # Uniform flat distribution (see Fortuna.random_value if this is the only behavior you need.)
quantum_monty.mostly_cycle()        # Cycled uniform flat distribution (see TruffleShuffle)
quantum_monty.mostly_not_middle()   # Mostly from the edges of the list (geometric upside down pyramid)
quantum_monty.mostly_not_center()   # Mostly from the outside edges of the list (inverted gaussian bell curve)
quantum_monty.quantum_not_monty()   # Inverted Quantum Monty Algorithm.
```


### Table Wrappers
#### Weighted Choice: Custom Rarity
Weighted Choice offers two strategies for selecting random values from a sequence where programmable rarity is desired. Both produce a custom distribution of values based on the weights of the values. Both are up to 10x faster than random.choices()

Flatten: Both will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

- Constructor takes a copy of a sequence of weighted value pairs... `[(weight, value), ... ]`
- Automatically optimizes the sequence for correctness and optimal call performance for large data sets.
- The sequence must not be empty, and each pair must contain a weight and a value.
- Weights must be positive integers.
- Values can be any Python object that can be passed around... string, int, list, function etc.
- Performance scales by some fraction of the length of the sequence.

The following examples produce equivalent distributions with comparable performance.
The choice to use one strategy over the other is purely about which one suits you or your data best. Relative weights are easier to understand at a glance. However, many RPG Treasure Tables map rather nicely to a cumulative weighted strategy.


##### Cumulative Weight Strategy
_Note: Logic dictates Cumulative Weights must be unique!_

```python
from Fortuna import CumulativeWeightedChoice


cumulative_weighted_choice = CumulativeWeightedChoice([
    (7, "Apple"),
    (11, "Banana"),
    (13, "Cherry"),
    (23, "Grape"),
    (26, "Lime"),
    (30, "Orange"),
])

cumulative_weighted_choice()  # returns a weighted random value
```


##### Relative Weight Strategy
Relative weights work just like cumulative weights, except each weight is comparable to the others.


```python
from Fortuna import RelativeWeightedChoice


relative_weighted_choice = RelativeWeightedChoice([
    (7, "Apple"),
    (4, "Banana"),
    (2, "Cherry"),
    (10, "Grape"),
    (3, "Lime"),
    (4, "Orange"),
])

relative_weighted_choice()  # returns a weighted random value
```


### Dictionary Wrappers
#### FlexCat
FlexCat wraps a dictionary of sequences. When the primary method is called it returns a random value from one of the sequences. It takes two optional keyword arguments to specify the algorithms used to make random selections.

By default, FlexCat will use y_bias="front" and x_bias="cycle", this will make the top of the data structure geometrically more common than the bottom and cycle the sequences. This config is known as Top Cat, it produces a descending-step cycled distribution for the data. Many other combinations are possible (12 algorithms, 2 dimensions = 144 possible configurations).

FlexCat generally works best if all sequences in a set are sufficiently large and close to the same size, this is not enforced. Values in a shorter sequence will naturally be more common, since probability balancing between categories is not considered. For example: in a flat/flat set where it might be expected that all values have equal probability (and they would, given sequences with equal length). However, values in a sequence half the size of the others in the set would have exactly double the probability of the other items. This effect scales with the size delta and affects all nine methods. Cross category balancing might be considered for a future release.

Flatten: FlexCat will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

    "Cat_B": ("B1", "B2", "B3", "B4", "B5"),
    "Cat_C": ("C1", "C2", "C3", "C4", "C5"),
}, y_bias="front", x_bias="cycle")

flex_cat()          # returns a random value from a random category
flex_cat("Cat_A")   # returns a random value from "Cat_A"
flex_cat("Cat_B")   #                             "Cat_B"
flex_cat("Cat_C")   #                             "Cat_C"
```
