Description: ## snorkel.lite
        
        snorkel.lite is a re-implementation of [snorkel](https://github.com/logv/snorkel) in python
        
        
        ### installation
        
        ```
        git clone --single-branch -b slite git@github.com:logv/snorkel.git slite
        cd slite
        make setup
        make run
        ```
        
        ### configuration
        
        see docs/SETUP.md
        
        
        ### status
        
        
        **Feb 2nd 2019**
        
        snorkel.lite is now in Alpha status. All but two views (digraph and map view)
        have been ported over from snorkel, data ingestion works and grafana endpoints
        are compatible. I have switched over from using the original snorkel to using
        snorkel.lite since November of 2018.
        
        
        ### motivation
        
        the reasons for moving to python are severalfold:
        
        * nodejs apps are annoying to maintain and deploy, as there is too much churn in the nodejs ecosystem
        * backend devs don't like writing javascript, but don't seem to mind writing python
        * writing an app just for sybil lets us move past old baggage of supporting mongodb and postgres
        
        ### goals
        
        * write an easy to deploy UI for browsing data kept in sybil
        * make it easy to extend and write new views
        * make an app that is easy to white label (and self host inside organizations)
        * re-use as much work from original snorkel while keeping the implementation clean
        * minimize external dependencies: use sqlite for data store, flask for web, etc
