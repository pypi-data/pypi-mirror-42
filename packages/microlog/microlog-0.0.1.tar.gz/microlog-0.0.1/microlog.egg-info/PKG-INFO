Description: # microlog
        Simple, lightweight logging
        
        ## Getting started
        ```
        from microlog import Logger
        my_logs = Logger()
        my_logs.log("Hello World!")
        ```
        * Logs can be created with the following methods
          * `log()`
          * `debug()`
          * `info()`
          * `warning()`
          * `error()`
          * `critical()`
        * Logs from a current session are saved in memory and can be viewed with the `logs()` method.
        
        ## Options
        There are four options available when creating a new Logger instance.
        ### 1. filename
        When creating a new Logger, a file will be created in your current directory. By default, the name will be the current time with the format _yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss_. You may provide a custom name for the log file with the `filename` parameter.
        ```
        Logger(filename = "my_logs")
        ```
        The `log` method uses the append option for writing so old log files can be written to.
        ### 2. file
        By default, a log file will be created when creating a new logger. Set the `file` parameter to `False` to prevent a log file from being created.
        ```
        Logger(file = False)
        ```
        ### 3. console
        Log messages will not be written to the console by default. Set the `console` parameter to `True` to see log messages in the console.
        ```
        Logger(console = True)
        ```
        ### 4. format
        All references to time will be local date-time by default. To use a UTC timestamp, set the `format` parameter to `"ts"`.  This will apply to default log file names and times in the log files.
        ```
        Logger(format = "ts")
        ```
