Description: Overview
        ********
        
        A `slackbot <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot>`__ plugin that acts as
        a general purpose Slack bot. Although botty\_mcbotface is not sentient,
        it does display a little sense of humor.
        
        Much inspiration drawn from snoonet's
        `gonzobot <https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot>`__ for IRC. The main
        build is from lins05's
        `slackbot <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot>`__, which
        botty\_mcbotface is technically a plugin for (though he himself has a
        multitude of plugins as well).
