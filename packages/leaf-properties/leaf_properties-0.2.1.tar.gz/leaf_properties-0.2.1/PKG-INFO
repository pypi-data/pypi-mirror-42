Description: =====================
        lidar_leaf_properties
        =====================
        
        This is a library for extracting structural properties about tree leaves represented by point clouds.
        
        The lidar_leaf_properties library is being developed as part of my PhD research, supervised by Dr. Mat Disney, in the Department of Geography at University College London (UCL). My research 
        is funded through Science Without Borders from the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (10.13039/501100003593) â€“ Brazil (Process number 233849/2014-9).
