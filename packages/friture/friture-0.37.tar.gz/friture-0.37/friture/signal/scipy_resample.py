def resample(x, num, t=None, axis=0, window=None):
    """
    Resample `x` to `num` samples using Fourier method along the given axis.

    The resampled signal starts at the same value as `x` but is sampled
    with a spacing of ``len(x) / num * (spacing of x)``.  Because a
    Fourier method is used, the signal is assumed to be periodic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data to be resampled.
    num : int
        The number of samples in the resampled signal.
    t : array_like, optional
        If `t` is given, it is assumed to be the sample positions
        associated with the signal data in `x`.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of `x` that is resampled.  Default is 0.
    window : array_like, callable, string, float, or tuple, optional
        Specifies the window applied to the signal in the Fourier
        domain.  See below for details.

    Returns
    -------
    resampled_x or (resampled_x, resampled_t)
        Either the resampled array, or, if `t` was given, a tuple
        containing the resampled array and the corresponding resampled
        positions.

    Notes
    -----
    The argument `window` controls a Fourier-domain window that tapers
    the Fourier spectrum before zero-padding to alleviate ringing in
    the resampled values for sampled signals you didn't intend to be
    interpreted as band-limited.

    If `window` is a function, then it is called with a vector of inputs
    indicating the frequency bins (i.e. fftfreq(x.shape[axis]) ).

    If `window` is an array of the same length as `x.shape[axis]` it is
    assumed to be the window to be applied directly in the Fourier
    domain (with dc and low-frequency first).

    For any other type of `window`, the function `scipy.signal.get_window`
    is called to generate the window.

    The first sample of the returned vector is the same as the first
    sample of the input vector.  The spacing between samples is changed
    from dx to:

        dx * len(x) / num

    If `t` is not None, then it represents the old sample positions,
    and the new sample positions will be returned as well as the new
    samples.
