==========================
Weave 0.17.0 Release Notes
==========================

Weave provides tools for including C/C++ code within Python code. Inlining
C/C++ code within Python generally results in speedups of 1.5x to 30x over
algorithms written in pure Python.

Weave is the stand-alone version of the now-removed SciPy submodule ``scipy.weave``.
It is Python 2.x only, and is provided for users that need new versions of
SciPy but have existing code that still depends on ``scipy.weave``. For new code,
users are recommended to use Cython.

Weave 0.17.0 is a maintenance release that fixes compatibility with NumPy
1.16.x.

This release requires Python 2.6 or 2.7.
