Weave 0.16.0 Release Notes
==========================

Weave provides tools for including C/C++ code within Python code. Inlining
C/C++ code within Python generally results in speedups of 1.5x to 30x over
algorithms written in pure Python.

Weave is the stand-alone version of the deprecated Scipy submodule scipy.weave.
It is Python 2.x only, and is provided for users that need new versions of
Scipy (from which the weave submodule may be removed) but have existing code
that still depends on scipy.weave. For new code, users are recommended to use
Cython.

Weave 0.16.0 is a maintenance release that accounts for changes in SciPy since
the Weave 0.15.0 release.

This release requires Python 2.6 or 2.7.
