ClamAV Signature Mirroring Tool
===============================

Why
---

The existing
`clamdownloader.pl <https://github.com/akissa/clamav-faq/blob/master/mirrors/clamdownloader.pl>`__
script does not have any error correction it simply bails out if a
downloaded file is not valid and is unable to retry different mirrors if
one fails.

This script will retry if a download fails with an http code that is not
404, it will connect to another mirror if retries fail or file not found
or if the downloaded file is invalid.

It has options to set the locations for the working and mirror directory
as well as user/group ownership for the downloaded files. It uses
locking to prevent multiple instances from running at the same time.
