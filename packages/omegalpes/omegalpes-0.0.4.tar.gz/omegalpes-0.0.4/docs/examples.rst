Basic example. PV self-consumption
----------------------------------
In this PV self-consuption example, a single-house with roof-integrated photovoltaic 
panels (PV) is studied. Specifically, the study case is about demand-side management 
in order to maximize the self-consumption, by shifting two household appliances consumption 
(clothes washing machine and clothes dryer) and using a water tank for the
domestic hot water consumption. This example is available online at:
