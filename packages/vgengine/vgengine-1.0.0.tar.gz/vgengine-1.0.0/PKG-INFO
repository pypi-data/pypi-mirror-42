Description: # Python Video Game Engine
        
        A Python Video Game Engine powered by Pygame and Pymunk.
        
        Make sure to run `python setup.py install`.
        
        A game engine is essentially an SDL wrapper with a Physics Engine tied together with a robuts API of generalized Game Objects and Components.
        
        Because of this, the component/system implementation of this engine resulted in three main systems:
        
        * Physics
        * Graphics
        * Control
        
        Coincidentally, this is essentially 
        
        * Model
        * View
        * Control
        
        the `examples` directory contains a working example of how to use the game engine, the components, and ultimately playing a rendering a simple scene that uses physics and graphics.
