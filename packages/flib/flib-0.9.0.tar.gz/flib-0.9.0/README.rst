The *Frootlab Shared Library* (flib) is a multi-purpose `Python`_ library, which
primarily aims to support `Frootlab`_ projects by a common base library.
The majority of the provided modules, however, are kept generic to facilitate
the application in other projects as well.

The library flib was originally created in 2019 to allow a separation or the
universal database proxy `Pandora`_ from the collaborative machine learning
framework `Nemoa`_. For more information see the respective project pages.
