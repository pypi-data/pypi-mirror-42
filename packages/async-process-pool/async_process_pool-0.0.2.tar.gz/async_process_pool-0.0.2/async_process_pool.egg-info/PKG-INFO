Description: # Async Process Pool and Queue
        
        This contains an `asyncio` aware multiprocessing utility that allows work to be scheduled across multiple processes.
        
        It consists of the following sub-utilities:
        - Async Process Queue: allows awaitable cross-process queues
        - Process Pool: allows for a pool of processes to be created which can take work. 
        Communication to these processes is via an async process queue.
        - Watchdog: a asyncio implementation of a watchdog timer. It will fire an action if it is not reset within a set time. For example: re-registering a worker if a heartbeat signal is not received at least every 5 seconds.
        
        ## Requirements
        This library requires Python 3.7 or greater to be able to run. The library package installer will block attempts to use Python 3.6 or lower.
        
        The library is tested on Python 3.7, taking advantage of significant improvements to the `asyncio` API and implementation in Python.
        It is tested most heavily on Debian/Ubuntu Linux, but known to work on Microsoft Windows.
