Description: ==========
        haka-mqtt
        ==========
        
        The `haka_mqtt` package is reliable "weapons grade" MQTT client library.
        It contains a core mqtt reactor class built with provable reliability,
        and reproducibility as its fundamental goals.  A side effect is that the
        library turns out to be speedy as well.
        
        Status
        =======
        
        The project's core reactor is stable.  It has been tested on systems
        with thousands of distributed nodes in difficult field conditions.  The
        QoS=1 datapath is well field tested.  The QoS=0 and QoS=2 are not as
        thoroughly field tested.
        
        While the core reactor is very well tested the frontends are less
        tested.  You should pay attention to notes on the different frontends
        regarding their status and use.
        
        The haka library is mostly tested on Linux derivatives.  It may work on
        other platforms but this has not been tested by the authors and no
        definite reports of success have been reported to the authors.
        
        
        Installation
        =============
        
        The haka-mqtt package can be installed from `pypi.org <https://pypi.org>`_
        with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install haka-mqtt
        
        Usage
        ======
        
        A quick example of how the package can be used:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Standard python Packages
            import logging
        
            # 3rd-Party Packages
            from haka_mqtt.frontends.poll import (
                MqttPollClientProperties,
                BlockingMqttClient
            )
            from haka_mqtt.reactor import ACTIVE_STATES
            from mqtt_codec.packet import MqttTopic
        
            LOG_FMT='%(asctime)s %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s'
            logging.basicConfig(format=LOG_FMT, level=logging.INFO)
        
            properties = MqttPollClientProperties()
            properties.host = 'test.mosquitto.org'
            properties.port = 1883
            properties.ssl = False
        
            TOPIC = 'haka'
        
            c = BlockingMqttClient(properties)
            c.start()
            sub_ticket = c.subscribe([MqttTopic(TOPIC, 1)])
            c.on_suback = lambda c, suback: c.publish(TOPIC, 'payload', 1)
            c.on_publish = lambda c, publish: c.stop()
        
            while c.state in ACTIVE_STATES:
                c.poll(5.)
