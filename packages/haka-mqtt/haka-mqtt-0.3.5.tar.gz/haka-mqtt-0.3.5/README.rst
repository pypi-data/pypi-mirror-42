haka-mqtt
==========

The `haka_mqtt` package is reliable "weapons grade" MQTT client library.
It contains a core mqtt reactor class built with provable reliability,
and reproducibility as its fundamental goals.  A side effect is that the
library turns out to be speedy as well.

Status
=======

The project's core reactor is stable.  It has been tested on systems
with thousands of distributed nodes in difficult field conditions.  The
QoS=1 datapath is well field tested.  The QoS=0 and QoS=2 are not as
thoroughly field tested.

While the core reactor is very well tested the frontends are less
tested.  You should pay attention to notes on the different frontends
regarding their status and use.

The haka library is mostly tested on Linux derivatives.  It may work on
other platforms but this has not been tested by the authors and no
definite reports of success have been reported to the authors.


Installation
=============

The haka-mqtt package can be installed from `pypi.org <https://pypi.org>`_
with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install haka-mqtt

Usage
======

A quick example of how the package can be used:

.. code-block:: python

    # Standard python Packages
    import logging

    # 3rd-Party Packages
    from haka_mqtt.frontends.poll import (
        MqttPollClientProperties,
        BlockingMqttClient
    )
    from haka_mqtt.reactor import ACTIVE_STATES
    from mqtt_codec.packet import MqttTopic

    LOG_FMT='%(asctime)s %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s'
    logging.basicConfig(format=LOG_FMT, level=logging.INFO)

    properties = MqttPollClientProperties()
    properties.host = 'test.mosquitto.org'
    properties.port = 1883
    properties.ssl = False

    TOPIC = 'haka'

    c = BlockingMqttClient(properties)
    c.start()
    sub_ticket = c.subscribe([MqttTopic(TOPIC, 1)])
    c.on_suback = lambda c, suback: c.publish(TOPIC, 'payload', 1)
    c.on_publish = lambda c, publish: c.stop()

    while c.state in ACTIVE_STATES:
        c.poll(5.)
