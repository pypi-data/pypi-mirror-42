        Convert ocean numerical models grids,
        including UGRID and SGRID compliant files,
        to a variety of geo-like objects: GeoJSON, and shapefile.

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        Version 1.5.0
        
        * CFVariable axis methods will error out when more than 1 coords is found.
        
        Version 1.4.0
        
        * Fixed non-string properties bug in #40
        
        Version 1.3.0
        
        * Implemented most of netCDF4.Variable methods and properties in CFVariable.
          Things like var.shape or var.size will work by default without the need to
          request the original variable object.
        
        Version 1.2.0
        
        * Return the array of polygons and the shapely geometry.
        * Parse the CRS using the CF grid_mapping attribute.
        * Use the newer and faster unary_union instead of cascaded_union to compute the grid outline.
        
        Version 1.0.1
        
        * Cast connectivity array to int.
        
        Version 1.0.0
        
        * Construct the grid based on the variables rather the datasets.
          The variables are CF's smallest unit and the only way to get a unique valid grid for SGRID.
        * Dropped the dependency on iris, cartopy, pysgrid, and pyugrid.
        * Dropped raster object in lieu of the actual x,y or triangle data for plotting.
        * Added an option to reduce the precision for the GeoJSON.
        * Grid parsing is now done with a grid-aware CFVariable object.
        * Dropped parsing grid from iris.cube.
        * Grids names are 'ugrid', 'sgrid', 'unknown_1d', and 'unknown_2d'.
        
        Version 0.2.1
        
        * Use latest pysgrid API.
        
        Version 0.2.0
        
        * Parse iris cubes with more than one X, Y axis.
        
        Version 0.1.0
        
        * Added a properties for raster representation (via the rasterize method)
          and vector outline (via shapely's' cascaded_union).
        * Re-factor the package into utilities.py and gridgeo.py.
        * Removed precision argument. (Created degenerated polygons.)
        * The __repr__ now return the original grid __repr__ if u/s-grid
          or the original nc object if the grid is "unknown."
        * Simplified the GridGeo class.
          (Moved all the loading stuff to load_grid.)
        * Caching expensive computations.
        
        Version 0.0.1
        
        * First version of `gridgeo`.
