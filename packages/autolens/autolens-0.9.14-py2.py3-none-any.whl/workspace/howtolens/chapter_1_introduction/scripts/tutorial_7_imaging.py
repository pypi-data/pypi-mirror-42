# In this example, we'll use the 'ccd' module (imported as 'im') to 'simulate' an regular of a strong lens made
# using a tracer_without_subhalo. By simulate, we mean that it will appear as if we had observed it using a real telescope,
# with this example making an regular representative of Hubble Space Telescope ccd.

# To simulate an regular, we need to model the telescope's optics. We'll do this by convolving the regular with a
# Point-Spread Function, which we can simulate as a Gaussian using the ccd module.
psf = im.PSF.simulate_as_gaussian(shape=(11, 11), pixel_scale=0.1, sigma=0.1)

# To simulate an regular, we use a special type of grid. This pads the grid_stacks 2D dimensions relative to the PSF-shape,
# to ensure that the edge's of our simulated regular are not degraded.

# Now, lets setup our lens model_galaxy, source model_galaxy and tracer_without_subhalo.

ray_tracing_plotters.plot_image_plane_image(tracer=tracer)

# To simulate the regular, we don't use the regular-plane regular plotted above. Instead, we use an  regular-plane regular
# which has been generated specifically for simulating an regular, using the padded grid above that ensures
# edge-effects do not degrade our simulation's PSF convolution.

# Now, to simulate the regular, we pass the tracer_without_subhalo's regular-plane regular to the ccd module's simulate function. This
# adds the following effects:

# 1) Telescope optics: Using the Point Spread Function above.
# 2) The Background Sky: Although the regular that is returned is automatically background sky subtracted.
# 3) Poisson noise_map: Due to the background sky, lens model_galaxy and source model_galaxy Poisson photon counts.

# Lets plot the regular - we can see the regular has been blurred due to the telescope optics and noise_map has been added.
imaging_plotters.plot_image_subplot(image=image_simulated)

# You've just completed your third tutorial, try the following:

# 1) Change the size (sigma) of the PSF, what happens to the lensed source model_galaxy's appearance?
# 2) Increase the background sky level of the simulation - what happens to the regular?
# 3) Increase the expousre time of the simulation - what happens as you change this and the background sky?
