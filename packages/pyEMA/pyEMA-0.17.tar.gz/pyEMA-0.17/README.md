# pyEMA

Experimental and operational modal analysis

## Basic usage

### Make an instance of **lscf** class:
```
a = pyema.lscf(
    frf_matrix,
    frequency_array,
    lower=50,
    upper=10000,
    pol_order_high=60
    )
```
### Compute poles:
```
a.get_poles()
```
### Determine correct poles:
1. Display **stability chart**
```
a.stab_chart(a.all_poles, legend=False)
```
The stability chart displayes calculated poles and the user can hand-pick the stable ones. Reconstruction is done on-the-fly. In this case the reconstruction is not necessary since the user can access FRF matrix and modal constant matrix:
```
a.H # FRF matrix
a.A # modal constants matrix
```
2. If the approximate values of natural frequencies are already known, it is not necessary to display the stability chart as it is computationally expensive:
```
approx_nat_freq = [314, 864]
a.identification(approx_nat_freq)
```
### Access the identified natural frequencies and damping coefficients:
```
a.nat_freq # natrual frequencies
a.nat_xi # damping coefficients
```
### Reconstruction:
1. Reconstruction using **own** poles
```
H, A = a.lsfd(whose_poles='own', FRF_ind='all') 
```
**H** is reconstructed FRF matrix and **A** is a matrix of modal constants.

2. Reconstruction on **c** using poles from **a**
```
c = pyema.lscf(frf_matrix, 
    frequency_array, 
    lower=50, 
    upper=10000, 
    pol_order_high=60)
    
H, A = c.lsfd(whose_poles=a, FRF_ind='all')
```
