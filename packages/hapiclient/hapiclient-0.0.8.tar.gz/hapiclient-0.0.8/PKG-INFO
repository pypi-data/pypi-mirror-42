        Installation
        ------------
        
        Standard Method
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Operating system command line:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install hapiclient
        
        See the `Appendix <#Appendix>`__ for a fail-safe
        installation method.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        All of the features are extensively demonstrated in the `hapi\_demo.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The notebook shows example usage of the functions in this package that can be copied into a script or onto a Python command line.
        
        The output of the non-executable version of the notebook can be viewed
        
        * `at jupyter.org <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hapi-server/client-python/blob/master/hapi_demo.ipynb>`__ or
        * `at GitHub <https://github.com/hapi-server/client-python/blob/master/hapi_demo.ipynb>`__ (buggy)
        
        To view and execute this notebook locally, enter the following on the command line.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install hapiclient # Install hapiclient package
            curl -L -O https://rawgithub.com/hapi-server/client-python/master/hapi_demo.ipynb
            jupyter-notebook hapi_demo.ipynb # Launches browser window
        
        
        To view the help string on the Python command line after installing `hapiclient` using `pip install hapiclient`, use
        
        .. code:: python
        
             from hapiclient import hapi
             help(hapi)
        
        or
        
        .. code:: python
        
              from hapiclient import hapiplot
              help(hapiplot)
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/hapi-server/client-python
            cd client-python; python setup.py develop
        
        (The command python setup.py develop creates symlinks so that the local
        package is used instead of an installed package. Use
        ``pip uninstall hapiclient`` to ensure the local package is used.)
        
        To run tests before a commit, execute
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            make repository-test
        
        To run an individual unit test in a Python session, use, e.g.,
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from hapiclient.test.test_hapi import test_reader
            test_reader()
        
        Contact
        -------
        
        Submit bug reports and feature requests on the `repository issue
        tracker <https://github.com/hapi-server/client-python/issues>`__.

        Appendix
        --------
        
        Fail-safe installation
        
        Python command line:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import os
            print(os.popen("pip install hapiclient").read())
        
        The above executes and displays the output of the operating system
        command ``pip install hapiclient`` using the shell environment
        associated with that installation of Python.
        
        This method addresses a problem that is sometimes encountered when
        attempting to use ``pip`` packages in Anaconda. To use a ``pip`` package
        in Anaconda, one must use the version of ``pip`` installed with Anaconda
        (it is usually under a subdirectory with the name ``anaconda/``) as
        opposed to the one installed with the operating system. To see the
        location of ``pip`` used in a given Python session, enter
        ``print(os.popen("which pip").read())``.
