        Kek it easy.
        
        Kekas is a simple tool for training neural networks on Pytorch.
        
        I tried to keep it as simple as possible.

        # Quick start guide
        
        I don't beieve in quick start guides, I think that they create more questions 
        than answers.
        
        Instead, I've created a detailed [Tutorial notebook](Tutorial.ipynb). Read it.
