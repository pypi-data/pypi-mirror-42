        Inspired by some DIY projects, this script allows you to quickly discern
        weather conditions by changing the colors of LEDs to reflect the current
        METAR information. You will need a Raspberry Pi, some WS281X LEDs, and
        the four letter designators of the airports you are interested in.
        
        This code assumes you've connected to GPIO 18 (PWM0) and have added
        ``blacklist snd_bcm2835`` to the ``/etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf``
        file.
        
        Don't want to DIY it? This is the code that powers the `Aviation Weather
        Maps <https://aviationweathermaps.com>`__ products. Enjoy a premade
        product, or continue reading and happy tinkering!
        
        Install
        =======
        
        ::
        
            sudo su
            apt install python3-venv
            python3 -m venv /opt/rpi_metar
            source /opt/rpi_metar/bin/activate
            pip install rpi_metar
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        You need to tell ``rpi_metar`` which LEDs correspond to which airports.
        You may do this by creating the ``/etc/rpi_metar.conf`` file. There must
        be an ``[airports]`` section where the airport codes are assigned to
        LEDs. For example:
        
        ::
        
            [airports]
            KDEN = 0
            KBOS = 1
        
        The LED indexes can be skipped and do not need to be continuous. If you
        don't have an LED associated with an airport, it does not need to be
        entered.
        
        You may also control the intensity of the LEDs via the configuration
        file. There must be a ``[settings]`` section. Within there, a brightness
        can be set (integer values from 0 to 255). In a well lit room, 75 or 85
        are recommended. In a brighter room, try 128.
        
        ::
        
            [settings]
            brightness = 85
        
        Autostart
        =========
        
        Create the ``/etc/systemd/system/rpi_metar.service`` file with the
        following contents:
        
        ::
        
            [Unit]
            Description=METAR Display
        
            [Service]
            ExecStart=/opt/rpi_metar/bin/rpi_metar
            User=root
            Group=root
            Restart=always
        
            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target
        
        Make systemd aware of the changes:
        
        ::
        
            systemctl daemon-reload
        
        Make sure it's set to run at boot:
        
        ::
        
            systemctl enable rpi_metar
        
        Start the service:
        
        ::
        
            systemctl start rpi_metar
