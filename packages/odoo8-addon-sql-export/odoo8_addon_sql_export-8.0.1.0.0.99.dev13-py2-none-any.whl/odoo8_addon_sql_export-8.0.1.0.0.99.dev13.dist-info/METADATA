SQL Export
==========

Allow to export data in csv files FROM sql requests.
There are some restrictions in the sql sql request, you can only read datas.
No update, deletion or creation are possible.
A new menu named Export is created.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Some words are prohibeted and can't be used is the query in anyways, even in a select query :
    * delete
    * drop
    * insert
    * alter
    * truncate
    * execute
    * create
    * update

See sql_request_abstract module to fix this issue.

* checking SQL request by execution and rollback is disabled in this module
  since variables features has been introduced. This can be fixed by
  overloading _prepare_request_check_execution() function.
