def findBaselineF0(rawF, fs, axis=0, keepdims=False):
    """Find the baseline for a fluorescence imaging trace line.

    The baseline, F0, is the 5th-percentile of the 1Hz
    lowpass filtered signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rawF : array_like
        Raw fluorescence signal.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency of rawF, in Hz.
    axis : int, optional
        Dimension which contains the time series. Default is 0.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        Whether to preserve the dimensionality of the input. Default is
        `False`.

    Returns
    -------
    baselineF0 : numpy.ndarray
        The baseline fluorescence of each recording, as an array.

    Note
    ----
    In typical usage, the input rawF is expected to be sized
    `(numROI, numTimePoints, numRecs)`
    and the output will then be sized `(numROI, 1, numRecs)`
    if `keepdims` is `True`.
