# borgbackup - installation and basic usage

# I have already downloaded the binary release from github:
ls -l
# binary file + GPG signature

# verifying whether the binary is valid:
gpg --verify borg-linux64.asc borg-linux64

# install it as "borg":
cp borg-linux64 ~/bin/borg

# making it executable:
chmod +x ~/bin/borg

# yay, installation done! let's make backups!

# creating a repository:
borg init repo

# creating our first backup with stuff from "data" directory:
borg create --stats --progress --compression lz4 repo::backup1 data

# changing the data slightly:
echo "some more data" > data/one_file_more

# creating another backup:
borg create --stats --progress repo::backup2 data

# that was much faster! it recognized/deduplicated unchanged files.
# see the "Deduplicated size" column for "This archive"! :)

# extracting a backup archive:
mv data data.orig
borg extract repo::backup2

# checking if restored data differs from original data:
diff -r data.orig data

# no, it doesn't! :)

# listing the repo contents:
borg list repo

# listing the backup2 archive contents (shortened):
borg list repo::backup2 | tail

# easy, isn't it?

# if you like #borgbackup, spread the word!
