Description: <h1>rdftransformer Module Repository</h1>
        
        <p>
        This project is intendet to annotate data according to the ALKIS Ontology.
        
        Additionally it is desired for the tool to be generic.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        To install execute
        <pre>pip install rdftransformer</pre>
        
        or
        
        clone the repository with
        <pre>git clone https://gitlab.fokus.fraunhofer.de/Limbo/Annotation-tool.git</pre>
        and execute
        <pre>python setup.py install</pre>
        
        <em>If this doesn't work try to add the "--user" flag after one of the above installation statements.</em>
        
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        
        <p>
        Given that 'ontology.owl' and 'data.xml' directories are known: 
        
        <ol>
        <li>Importing the ontology with a preferred prefix. For alkis it would be <b>alk</b>.</li>
        <li>Importing the data to transform.</li>
        <li>Getting the desired elements from the data.xml.</li>
        <li>Looping through the elements and transforming them.</li>
        <li>Outputting the transformed data to console or file.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Example Code:</p>
        <pre><code>
        from rdftransformer import Annotation
        
        a = Annotation()
        a.importOntology("ontology.owl", ["ontologyPrefix"])
        a.importData("data.xml")
        
        elements = a.getElementsByTagName("elementName", "parentName")
        for element in elements:
        	a.annotate(element)
        
        a.output()
        </code></pre>
        </p>
