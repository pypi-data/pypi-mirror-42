class Packets(BaseInterface):
    """This object covers packets stored in the Kismet DB.


    The actual packet is stored in the `packet` field of the dictionary
    returned for every row. This can be a very expensive abstraction to
    use if you don't employ some sort of filtering on your query. Consider
    using the `Packets.get_meta()` method to retrieve only the metadata
    (not the actual packet capture), which will preserve performance.


    Args:
        file_location (str): Path to Kismet log file.

    Keyword args:
        ts_sec_lt (str, datetime.datetime): Match packets where the timestamp
            is before this.
        ts_sec_gt (str, datetime.datetime): Match packets where the timestamp
            is after this.
        phyname (str or list): Exact match against PHY name.
        sourcemac (str or list): Exact match against source MAC address.
        destmac (str or list): Exact match against destination MAC address.
        transmac (str or list): Exact match against trans mac.
        devkey (str or list): Exact match against devkey.
        datasource (str or list): Exact match against datasource.
        min_signal (str or int): Minimum signal.
        dlt_gt (str or int): Minimum DLT.


    Attributes:
        bulk_data_field (str): Field containing bulk data (typically stored
            as a blob in the DB). This allows the `get_meta()` method to
            exclude information which may have a performance impact. This
            is especially true for the retrieval of packet captures.
        column_names (str): Name of columns expected to be in table represented
            by this abstraction. Used for validation against columns in
            DB on instanitation.
        table_name (str): Name of the table this abstraction represents.
        valid_kwargs (str): This is a dictionary where the key is the name
            of a keyword argument and the value is a reference to the function
            which builds the SQL partial and replacement dictionary.
