    "Each assay type also exposes a decoder. A decoder translates each spot (spot_id) in the encoded table into a gene that matches a barcode in the codebook. The goal is to decode and output a quality score, per spot, that describes the confidence in the decoding. Recall that in the MERFISH pipeline, each 'spot' is actually a 16 dimensional vector, one per pixel in the image. From here on, we will refer to these as pixel vectors. Once these pixel vectors are decoded into gene values, contiguous pixels that are decoded to the same gene are labeled as 'spots' via a connected components labeler. We shall refer to the latter as spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hard and soft decodings -- hard decoding is just looking for the max value in the code book. Soft decoding, by contrast, finds the closest code by distance in intensity. Because different assays each have their own intensities and error modes, we leave decoders as user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For MERFISH, which uses soft decoding, there are several parameters which are important to determining the result of the decoding method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance threshold\n",
    "In MERFISH, each pixel vector is a 16d vector that we want to map onto a barcode via minimum euclidean distance. Each barcode in the codebook, and each pixel vector is first mapped to the unit sphere by L2 normalization. As such, the maximum distance between a pixel vector and the nearest single-bit error barcode is 0.5176. As such, the decoder only accepts pixel vectors that are below this distance for assignment to a codeword in the codebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnitude threshold\n",
    "This is a signal floor for decoding. Pixel vectors with an L2 norm below this floor are not considered for decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Area threshold\n",
    "Contiguous pixels that decode to the same gene are called as spots via connected components labeling. The minimum area of these spots are set by this parameter. The intuition is that pixel vectors, that pass the distance and magnitude thresholds, shold probably not be trusted as genes as the mRNA transcript would be too small for them to be real. This parameter can be set based on microscope resolution and signal amplification strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crop size\n",
    "The crop size crops the image by a number of pixels large enough to eliminate parts of the image that suffer from boundary effects from both signal aquisition (e.g., FOV overlap) and image processing. Here this value is 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these three thresholds, for each pixel vector, the decoder picks the closest code (minimum distance) that satisfies each of the above thresholds, where the distance is calculated between the code and a normalized intensity vector and throws away subsequent spots that are too small."
