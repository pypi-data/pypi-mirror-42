### Show input file format that specifies how the tiff stack is organized
#
#The stack contains multiple single plane images, one for each color channel, 'c', (columns in above image) and imaging round, 'r', (rows in above image). This protocol assumes that genes are encoded with a length 4 quatenary barcode that can be read out from the images. Each round encodes a position in the codeword. The maximum signal in each color channel (columns in the above image) corresponds to a letter in the codeword. The channels, in order, correspond to the letters: 'T', 'G', 'C', 'A'. The goal is now to process these image data into spatially organized barcodes, e.g., ACTG, which can then be mapped back to a codebook that specifies what gene this codeword corresponds to.

#Below, this computes the max projection across the color channels of an imaging round and learns the linear transformation to maps the resulting image onto the dots image.

#In the below table, Error is the minimum mean-squared error, and shift reports changes in x and y dimension.

# EPY: END code

# EPY: START markdown
# The Encoder table is the hypothesized standardized file format for the output of a spot detector, and is the first output file format in the pipeline that is not an image or set of images
# EPY: END markdown

# EPY: START markdown
#`attributes` is produced by the encoder and contains all the information necessary to map the encoded spots back to the original image
#
#`x, y` describe the position, while `x_min` through `y_max` describe the bounding box for the spot, which is refined by a radius `r`. This table also stores the intensity and spot_id.
# EPY: END markdown

# EPY: START markdown
### Decode
# EPY: END markdown

# EPY: START markdown
#Each assay type also exposes a decoder. A decoder translates each spot (spot_id) in the Encoder table into a gene (that matches a barcode) and associates this information with the stored position. The goal is to decode and output a quality score that describes the confidence in the decoding.
# EPY: END markdown

# EPY: START markdown
#There are hard and soft decodings -- hard decoding is just looking for the max value in the code book. Soft decoding, by contrast, finds the closest code by distance (in intensity). Because different assays each have their own intensities and error modes, we leave decoders as user-defined functions.
