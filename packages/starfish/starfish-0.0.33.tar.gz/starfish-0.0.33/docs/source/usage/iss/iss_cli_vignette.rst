ISS Command Line Usage
----------------------

Starfish provides several notebook vignettes that demonstrate the starfish API. Starfish has a
fully-featured CLI that mimics the API such that one does not need to write python code to use
starfish. Running the commands below will re-produce the notebook_ results using starfish's CLI:

.. _notebook: notebooks/ISS_Simple_tutorial_-_Mouse_vs._Human_Fibroblasts.ipynb

.. literalinclude:: iss_cli.sh
