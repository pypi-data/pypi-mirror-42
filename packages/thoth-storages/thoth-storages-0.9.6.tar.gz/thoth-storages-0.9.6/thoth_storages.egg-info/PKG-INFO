Description: thoth-storages
        --------------
        This repo provides a library called
        `thoth-storages <https://pypi.org/project/thoth-storages>`_.
        The library exposes core queries and methods for JanusGraph database as well
        as adapters for manipulating with Ceph via its S3 compatible API.
        
        Installation and Usage
        ======================
        
        The library can be installed via pip or pipenv:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           pipenv install thoth-storages
        
        The library does not provide any CLI, it is rather a low level library
        supporting other parts of Thoth.
        
        You can run prepared testsuite via the following command:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            pipenv install --dev
            pipenv run python3 setup.py test
        
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
        - Gremlin queries are hanging:
        
           When using :code:`aiogremlin==3.3.1` (despite being not part of our specification, it might happen that another library overrides that dependency), gremlin queries might _hang indeffinitely_ without throwing any error in Jupyter Notebooks. Make sure to check that correct version of :code:`aiogremlin` is installed.
