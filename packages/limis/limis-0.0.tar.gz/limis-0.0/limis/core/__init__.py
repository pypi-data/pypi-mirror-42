    Most packages defined within limis have a settings.ini file and the default settings are loaded for each of those
    modules. Settings may be overwritten by passing additional settings files to the class initialization method.
    Additional settings files specified are loaded after limis modules. Limis packages without settings.ini are
    ignored, modules passed with additional_settings_files or the environment variable that do not exist will raise
    an error.

    Project specific settings are loaded from the environment variable "LIMIS_PROJECT_SETTINGS".

    Settings are loaded as attributes of instantiated Settings class. Each attribute name represents a section and is
    a dictionary of settings values.
