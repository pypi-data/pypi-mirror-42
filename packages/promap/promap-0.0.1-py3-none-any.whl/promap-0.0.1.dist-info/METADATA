`promap` is a command-line tool that you can use
in conjunction with your digital video workflow
to do projection mapping.

`promap` uses a projector and a single camera
to compute the physical scene as viewed from the projector,
as well as a coarse disparity (depth) map.

You can import the maps that it generates straight into your [digital video workflow](https://radiance.video),
or you can post-process them into masks and uvmaps first using image processing tools.
