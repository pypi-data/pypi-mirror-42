        |Version| |License| |Python| |Tests| |Coverage|
        
        cpymad is a Cython_ binding to MAD-X_ for giving full control and access to a
        MAD-X interpreter within the python environment.
        
        This version of cpymad should be built against MAD-X |VERSION|. It can be
        installed on linux, Windows and Mac (but I can't offer much help for Mac).
        Python 3 is recommended but not (yet) required.

        The cpymad source code itself is under free license.
        
        However, the MAD-X software package and henceforth all binary cpymad package
        distributions are **NOT FREE**.
        
        For more details, see COPYING.rst_ and the `MAD-X license`_.

        Reporting issues
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        cpymad is NOT maintained by CERN members and links against an unofficial build
        of MAD-X that is not supported by CERN, i.e. this binary may have problems
        that the official binary does not have and vice versa.
        
        If you have a problem with a sequence file, first try to check if that
        problem remains when using the MAD-X command line client distributed by
        CERN, then:
        
        - Report the issue to CERN only if it **can** be reproduced with their
          official command line client.
        - Report the issue here only if it can **not** be reproduced with their
          official command line client.
        
        For issues regarding the cpymad code itself or usage information, I'm happy to
        answer. Please keep it *precise*, *specific*, and *concise* and provide all
        the necessary information.
