birdbrain
==============================

Tim Sainburg

Work in progress.

This is a small library for viewing the songbird brain atlas' at https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/rg/bioimaging-lab/research/mri-atlases/starling-brain-atlas/ 


- TODO
  - fix colormap error where adjacent nuclei will be labelled with the same color (e.g. NCM and field L)
  - update package to work with other atlas'
  - generate STL files from brain images
  - pip installable
  - binder notebooks
  - proposed updated y-sinus differs from actual updated y-sinus - this appears to have to do with laterality flipping...
