  the correlation of alert information.  It is intended to group one or more previously-sent
  alerts together, to say "these alerts are all related". '

    name: name
    multiplicity: '1'
    type: STRING
    description: The reason for grouping the alerts together, for example, a particular
      correlation method.
  alertident:
    name: alertident
    multiplicity: 1..*
    type: STRING
    description: The list of alert identifiers that are related to this alert.  Because
      alert identifiers are only unique across the alerts sent by a single analyzer,
      the optional "analyzerid" attribute of "alertident" should be used to identify
      the analyzer that a particular alert came from.  If the "analyzerid" is not
      provided, the alert is assumed to have come from the same analyzer that is sending
      the CorrelationAlert.
