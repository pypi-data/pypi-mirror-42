name: ToolAlert
description: 'The ToolAlert class carries additional information related to the use
  of attack tools or malevolent programs such as Trojan horses and can be used by
  the analyzer when it is able to identify these tools.  It is intended to group one
  or more previously-sent alerts together, to say "these alerts were all the result
  of someone using this tool". '

aggregates:
  name:
    name: name
    multiplicity: '1'
    type: STRING
    description: The reason for grouping the alerts together, for example, the name
      of a particular tool.
  command:
    name: command
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: STRING
    description: The command or operation that the tool was asked to perform, for
      example, a BackOrifice ping.
  alertident:
    name: alertident
    multiplicity: 1..*
    type: STRING
    description: The list of alert identifiers that are related to this alert.  Because
      alert identifiers are only unique across the alerts sent by a single analyzer,
      the optional "analyzerid" attribute of "alertident" should be used to identify
      the analyzer that a particular alert came from.  If the "analyzerid" is not
      provided, the alert is assumed to have come from the same analyzer that is sending
      the ToolAlert.
