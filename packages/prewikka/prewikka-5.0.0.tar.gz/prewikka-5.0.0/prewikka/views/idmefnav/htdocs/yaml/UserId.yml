  from one user to another, or to provide complete information about a user''s (or
  process'') privileges. '

aggregates:
  name:
    name: name
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: STRING
    description: A user or group name.
  number:
    name: number
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: INTEGER
    description: A user or group number.
attributes:
  ident:
    name: ident
    multiplicity: Optional
    type: STRING
    description: A unique identifier for the user id, see Section 3.2.9.
  type:
    name: type
    multiplicity: Optional
    type: ENUM
    description: The type of user information represented.  The permitted values for
      this attribute are shown below.  The default value is "original-user".  (See
      also Section 10.)
    values:
    - rank: '0'
      keyword: current-user
      description: The current user id being used by the user or process.  On Unix
        systems, this would be the "real" user id, in general.
    - rank: '1'
      keyword: original-user
      description: The actual identity of the user or process being reported on.  On
        those systems that (a) do some type of auditing and (b) support extracting
        a user id from the "audit id" token, that value should be used.  On those
        systems that do not support this, and where the user has logged into the system,
        the "login id" should be used.
    - rank: '2'
      keyword: target-user
      description: The user id the user or process is attempting to become.  This
        would apply, on Unix systems for example, when the user attempts to use "su",
        "rlogin", "telnet", etc.
    - rank: '3'
      keyword: user-privs
      description: Another user id the user or process has the ability to use, or
        a user id associated with a file permission.  On Unix systems, this would
        be the "effective" user id in a user or process context, and the owner permissions
        in a file context.  Multiple UserId elements of this type may be used to specify
        a list of privileges.
    - rank: '4'
      keyword: current-group
      description: The current group id (if applicable) being used by the user or
        process.  On Unix systems, this would be the "real" group id, in general.
    - rank: '5'
      keyword: group-privs
      description: Another group id the group or process has the ability to use, or
        a group id associated with a file permission.  On Unix systems, this would
        be the "effective" group id in a group or process context, and the group permissions
        in a file context.  On BSD-derived Unix systems, multiple UserId elements
        of this type would be used to include all the group ids on the "group list".
    - rank: '6'
      keyword: other-privs
      description: Not used in a user, group, or process context, only used in the
        file context. The file permissions assigned to users who do not match either
        the user or group permissions on the file.  On Unix systems, this would be
        the "world" permissions.
  tty:
    name: tty
    multiplicity: Optional
    type: STRING
    description: The tty the user is using.
