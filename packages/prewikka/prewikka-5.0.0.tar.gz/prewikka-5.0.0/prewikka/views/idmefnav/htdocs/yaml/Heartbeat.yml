name: Heartbeat
description: 'Analyzers use Heartbeat messages to indicate their current status to
  managers.  Heartbeats are intended to be sent in a regular period, say, every ten
  minutes or every hour.  The receipt of a Heartbeat message from an analyzer indicates
  to the manager that the analyzer is up and running; lack of a Heartbeat message
  (or more likely, lack of some number of consecutive Heartbeat messages) indicates
  that the analyzer or its network connection has failed. '
