name: Analyzer
description: 'The Analyzer class identifies the analyzer from which the Alert or Heartbeat
  message originates.  Only one analyzer may be encoded for each alert or heartbeat,
  and that MUST be the analyzer at which the alert or heartbeat originated.  Although
  the IDMEF data model does not prevent the use of hierarchical intrusion detection
  systems (where alerts get relayed up the tree), it does not provide any way to record
  the identity of the "relay" analyzers along the path from the originating analyzer
  to the manager that ultimately receives the alert. '

    type:
    description: Information about the analyzer from which the message may have gone
      through.  The idea behind this mechanism is that when a manager receives an
      alert and wants to forward it to another analyzer, it needs to substitute the
      original analyzer
