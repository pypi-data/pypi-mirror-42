description: 'The File class provides specific information about a file or other file-like
  object that has been created, deleted, or modified on the target.  The description
  can provide either the file settings prior to the event or the file settings at
  the time of the event, as specified using the "category" attribute. '

aggregates:
  name:
    name: name
    multiplicity: '1'
    type: STRING
    description: The name of the file to which the alert applies, not including the
      path to the file.
  path:
    name: path
    multiplicity: '1'
    type: STRING
    description: The full path to the file, including the name.  The path name should
      be represented in as "universal" a manner as possible, to facilitate processing
      of the alert.
  create-time:
    name: create-time
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: DATETIME
    description: Time the file was created.  Note that this is *not* the Unix "st_ctime"
      file attribute (which is not file creation time).  The Unix "st_ctime" attribute
      is contained in the "Inode" class.
  modify-time:
    name: modify-time
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: DATETIME
    description: Time the file was last modified.
  access-time:
    name: access-time
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: DATETIME
    description: Time the file was last accessed.
  data-size:
    name: data-size
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: INTEGER
    description: The size of the data, in bytes.  Typically what is meant when referring
      to file size.  On Unix UFS file systems, this value corresponds to stat.st_size.  On
      Windows NTFS, this value corresponds to Valid Data Length (VDL).
  disk-size:
    name: disk-size
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: INTEGER
    description: The physical space on disk consumed by the file, in bytes.  On Unix
      UFS file systems, this value corresponds to 512 * stat.st_blocks.  On Windows
      NTFS, this value corresponds to End of File (EOF).
  FileAccess:
    name: FileAccess
    multiplicity: 0..*
    type:
    description: Access permissions on the file.
  Linkage:
    name: Linkage
    multiplicity: 0..*
    type:
    description: File system objects to which this file is linked (other references
      for the file).
  Inode:
    name: Inode
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type:
    description: Inode information for this file (relevant to Unix).
  Checksum:
    name: Checksum
    multiplicity: 0..*
    type:
    description: Checksum information for this file.
  ident:
    name: ident
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: STRING
    description: A unique identifier for this file; see Section 3.2.9.
  category:
    name: category
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: ENUM
    description: The type of file system the file resides on.  This attribute governs
      how path names and other attributes are interpreted.
    values:
    - rank: '0'
      keyword: current
      description: The file information is from after the reported change
    - rank: '1'
      keyword: original
      description: The file information is from before the reported change
  file-type:
    name: file-type
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: STRING
    description: The type of file, as a mime-type.
