name: DetectTime
description: 'The DetectTime class is used to indicate the date and time that the
  event(s) producing an alert was detected by the analyzer.  In the case of more than
  one event, it is the time that the first event was detected.  (This may or may not
  be the same time as CreateTime; analyzers are not required to send alerts immediately
  upon detection). '
