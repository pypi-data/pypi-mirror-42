description: 'The AdditionalData class is used to provide information that cannot
  be represented by the data model.  AdditionalData can be used to provide atomic
  data (integers, strings, etc.) in cases where only small amounts of additional information
  need to be sent; it can also be used to extend the data model and the DTD to support
  the transmission of complex data (such as packet headers).  Detailed instructions
  for extending the data model and the DTD are provided in Section 5. '

    description: A string describing the meaning of the element content. These values
      will be vendor/implementation dependent; the method for ensuring that managers
      understand the strings sent by analyzers is outside the scope of this specification.  A
      list of acceptable meaning keywords is not within the scope of the document,
      although later versions may undertake to establish such a list.
