* 2010-03-16, prewikka-1.0.0:

- Fix logout link from the Statistics view.

- Fix inline filtering problem for events name with start/ending space.

- Fix possible inline filter null reset button.

- Other, minor fixes.


* 2010-02-12, prewikka-1.0.0rc3:

- Make sure we always use a replacement ("n/a") when we get a nil
  value from the database. Fix exception since the underlying chart
  backend didn't support nil value (#370).

- If the requested timeline range is lower or equal 1 minute, use
  a 1 second step. Fix an exception using the Cairoplot backend, and
  allow to get meaningful by minute statistics (#370).


* 2010-02-10, prewikka-1.0.0rc2:

- The link to the logged-in user settings, when accessed through the
  Statistics subpages, contained an invalid parameters which triggered
  an exception.

- An exception could be raised in case we were generating a distribution
  Chart containing empty values. This close #369.

- Upgrade old database fields values to fit latest Prewikka changes. Fix
  a possible exception in the Events listing.

- Fix possible exception with username/charts name containing unicode.

- Correctly handle the setup.py installation 'root' argument.


* 2010-01-21, prewikka-1.0.0rc1:

- OpenSource Graphical Statistics implementation: implement a set of
  basic statistics for Prewikka, based on the (provided) Cairoplot
  rendering engine. This initial implementation provides
  Categorizations, Sources, Targets, Analyzers, and Timeline statistics.

- Only use analyzerid/messageid pair when linking to a set of correlated
  alerts. This fixes a problem where clicking on the link to expand the
  CorrelatedAlert list would bring an empty alert view, since previous
  filters where preserved.

- The link used to expand a list of sources/target was always broken. It
  now point to the detailed view for CorrelationAlert, or the detailed
  event for alert.

- Allow filtering empty value, by providing a new "Is Null" operator.

- Improve non aggregated delete, by providing a precise deletion scheme.

- Correctly provide the analyzer_time information.

- Various bug fixes.



* 2009-09-07, prewikka-0.9.17.1:

- Fix possible encoding error in the message summary view (#360).



* 2009-07-07, prewikka-0.9.17:

- Do not provide an exhaustive list of unreachable linked alert, rather,
  tell the user how many linked alert are not reachable any more.

- String encoding fixes, do not mix unicode and bytestring, and more
  generally, use unicode for internal string storage. This fixes a lot
  of possible exception with particular specific user input, or with
  localization enabled.

- Inline filter didn't work as expected when viewing events starting
  with a specific offset, because the offset keyword wasn't removed
  from the generated link.

- Error handling improvement (back / retry button weren't always
  working as expected).

- Fix exception when no protocol was available.

- Improve navigation button link (make the link cover the whole button).



* 2009-06-30, prewikka-0.9.16:

- Multiples advanced filter within the same column wouldn't display
  correctly.

- Correctly restore input field when switching between advanced/simple
  filter mode.

- Fix multiple bug that would results in inconsistant filtered "state"
  and reset button.

- Using the classification simple filter now also trigger a search on
  impact.completion.

- Fix multiple alert deletion checkbox, (#357).

- Various bug fixes.


* 2009-06-08, prewikka-0.9.15:

- Make it obvious when a column is filtered by replacing the old sober
  star with a big "[filtered]" red marker. If the column filter is
  saved, then the marker color will go from red to black.

- Once the user filtered a given field by clicking on it, deny further
  click so that it is clear that the filter is currently active.

- Re-write the inline filter implementation using Cheetah + Jquery, in
  place of generating an enormous amount of javascript code. This
  drastically reduce the size of the events listing HTML page, and will
  allow for much easier modification of the inline-filters.

- Only propose filter operator relevant to the selected path.

- Inline filter now present a single input field (with no path and
  operator selection). Using this field, the user can filter on what is
  seen in the associated column. For example, in the classification
  column, the filter will trigger a search on classification.text,
  classification.reference.name and classification.reference.origin.

  There is also an [advanced] button allowing the user to specify both
  the path and the operator.

- Implement a reset button in each inline filter column, that allow to
  switch between different version of the filter: last saved filters,
  default filters, or current filters.

- The user can now click an alert completion to set an inline filter on
  the completion value.

- Clicking on a port / protocol now trigger a CSS menu allowing to
  filter on the port and protocol information, or to get information
  concerning this port / protocol.

- Clicking on a classification reference now trigger a CSS menu which
  allow to filter on the reference, or to get more information
  concerning it.

- Clicking on classification now add a filter on the selected
  classification (previously, it would have unfolded aggregated alerts
  for the selected entry, which is now done clicking the alert count).

- Until now, the default user that was automatically created by Prewikka
  if there was no administrative user was "admin". As of now you can
  define the initial administrative username and password from the
  configuration file. (fix #289).

- Fix escaping for reference details URI parameters.

- Fix ModPython content-type handling.

- Invalid variable name, fix #339.

- Update to JQuery 1.3.2, and fit small JQuery API change.

- If the installed libprelude or libpreludedb version is too old,
  Prewikka will require the user to upgrade. Currently, Prewikka depend
  on libpreludedb 0.9.12, and libprelude 0.9.23.

- Fix IDMEFDatabase exception on empty criteria string (fixes #346).

- Analyzer retrieval fixes and speedup (fixes #350).



* 2008-03-27, prewikka-0.9.14:

- Let the user choose the type of sorting (default to time descending,
  available: time asc/desc, count asc/desc).

- Implement Prewikka Asynchronous DNS resolution in alert view
  as well as message summary (require twisted.names and twisted.internet),
  see the additional dns_max_delay settings parameters in prewikka.conf.

- In the alert summary view, handle portlist and ip_version service fields,
  and show alert messageid.

- Fix exception when rendering ToolAlert.

- Fix double classification escaping (could result in non working link
  for alert with classification containing escaped character).

- Improvement to heartbeat retrieval (heartbeat view speedup).

- Correct typo (fix #275), thanks Scott Olihovki <skippylou@gmail.com>
  for pointing this out.

- Polish translation, by Konrad Kosmowski <konrad@kosmosik.net>.

- Update to pt_BR translation, by Edelberto Franco Silva <edeunix@edeunix.com>

- Various bug fixes and cleanup.



* 2007-10-18, prewikka-0.9.13:

- Only perform additional database request when using Sensor localtime:
  this bring a performance improvement of about 36% on aggregated query,
  when using either frontend localtime (the default), or UTC time.

- JQuery support: Port most of the javascript code to make use of JQuery.
  Add show/hide effect to CSS popup. More filtering functionality in the
  SensorListing view.

- Cleanup the Authentication class, so that uper Prewikka layer can act
  depending whether the backend support user creation / deletion. Anonymous
  authentication is nowa plugin.

- Better integration of CGI authentication allowing user listing and deletion.

- Report template exception directly to the user.

- Fix exception if an alert analyzer name is empty.

- Fix problem when adding new Prewikka users (#262).

- Fix exception when user has no permission set.

- When changing password, we didn't try to match an empty 'current password'
  (which is a minor issue since the user is already authenticated). Thanks
  to Helmut Azbest <helmut.azbest@gmail.com> for the fix.

- Fix a typo making mod_python use the parent method (patch from
  Helmut Azbest <helmut.azbest@gmail.com>).
