Description: 
        *AlphaTwirl* is a python library that summarizes event data into
        multivariate categorical data as data frames. Event data, input to
        AlphaTwirl, are data with one entry (or row) for one event: for
        example, data in `ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/>`__ `TTrees
        <https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html>`__ with one entry
        per collision event of an `LHC
        <https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider>`__ experiment at
        `CERN <http://home.cern/>`__. Event data are often large---too large
        to be loaded in memory---because they have as many entries as events.
        Multivariate categorical data, the output of AlphaTwirl, have one row
        for one category. They are usually small---small enough to be loaded
        in memory---because they only have as many rows as categories. Users
        can, for example, import them as data frames into `R
        <https://www.r-project.org/>`__ and `pandas
        <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__, which usually load all data in memory,
        and can perform categorical data analyses with a rich set of data
        operations available in R and pandas.
