        Xena CLI does not distinguish between attributes, operations and statistics. All are flat, unstructured, commands.
        
        Each object has the following sub-routes - commands, attributes, statistics, operations.
        Note that for some objects some of the sub-routes are not applicable and in this case the sub-route is missing.
        
        Commands:
        - Any raw CLI command.
        
        The following sub-routes are abstractions on top of the raw CLI commands represented in the commands sub-route.
        
        Attributes:
        - Returns all attributes in one call as dictionary
        - Allows set of group of attributes
        
        Statistics:
        - Structured statistics.
        
        Operations:
        - Strcutured operations. Not supported in first release.
