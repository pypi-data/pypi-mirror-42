        Pytest plugin to restrict the test types allowed.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        This plugin allows you to restrict the test types allowed to ensure they
        inherit from one of a given list of classes. You might need this on large
        projects where you have custom test classes that developers might forget about.
        
        About
        -----
        
        I developed this feature in a closed source Nose plugin whilst working on the
        big Django project at YPlan. We had some custom enhancements and fixes on top
        of the Django test classes, but developers sometimes forgot about using them
        and instead used the built-in ``unittest`` classes, or the plain Django ones.
        Our solution was to just make the test runner blow up if it encountered
        non-whitelisted test types. This is a Pytest port of that plugin.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install from pip with:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install pytest-restrict
        
        Python 3.4+ supported.
        
        Pytest will automatically find the plugin and use it when you run ``py.test``,
        however by default there are no restrictions. To restrict the test types,
        provide ``--restrict-types`` as a comma-separated list of import paths to
        allowable test case base classes, for example:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # Allow only test cases that inherit from Django
            py.test --restrict-types django.test.TestCase,django.test.SimpleTestCase
        
        If you wish to allow function tests and other non-class test types (e.g.
        doctests), provide the special string 'None', for example:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            # Allow function tests and our custom tests
            py.test --restrict-types None,myproject.test.TestCase

        Pending Release
        ---------------
        
        .. Insert new release notes below this line
        
        3.0.0 (2018-02-28)
        ------------------
        
        * Drop Python 2 support, only Python 3.4+ is supported now.
        
        2.0.0 (2016-04-29)
        ------------------
        
        * Changed the format of ``--restrict-types`` to take a comma-separated list of
          import paths rather than space separated, which fixes the parsing of e.g.
          ``py.test --restrict-types my.TestCase run/these/test_files.py``.
        
        1.0.0 (2016-04-17)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI
