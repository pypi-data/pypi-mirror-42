Expy is an simple-yet-powerful experiment framework builder for cognitive tasks. It's aimed at setting up an experiment without struggling with the manual production of stimuli, data loading and storing, or the other time-consuming works.

**Highlights**:

- Various stimuli modules (not need for preparation of massive stimuli pictures).
- Various procedure-controlling modules (instruction, tip, rest-stage, etc.)
- Convenient for stimuli loading and responses recording.
- Convenient for getting participants' response data (from keyboard, mouse, or joystick).
- Sending triggers easily.
- Easy pause or exit from the program.

**Limitation**:

- Not good at drawing complex shape (e.g.,grating) as stimuli (however, you could draw them as loaded pictures).
