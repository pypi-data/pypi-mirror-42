    """
    The SummarizeNearby task finds features that are within a specified distance of features in the input layer.
    Distance can be measured as a straight-line distance, a drive-time distance (for example, within 10 minutes), or a
    drive distance (within 5 kilometers). Statistics are then calculated for the nearby features. For example:Calculate
    the total population within five minutes of driving time of a proposed new store location.Calculate the number of
    freeway access ramps within a one-mile driving distance of a proposed new store location to use as a measure of
    store accessibility.

    summary_layer : Required layer (see Feature Input in documentation)
        Point, line, or polygon features. Features in this layer that are within the specified distance to features in
        the sumNearbyLayer will be summarized.

        If true, will return a result layer of areas that contain the requested summary information.  The resulting
        areas are defined by the specified nearType.  For example, if using a StraightLine of 5 miles, your result will
        contain areas with a 5 mile radius around the input features and specified summary information.If false, the
        resulting layer will return the same features as the input analysis layer with requested summary information.

        the summaryLayer within each polygon in sumWithinLayer.

        Specify a field from the summaryLayer features to calculate statistics separately for each unique value of the
        field.

        This boolean parameter is applicable only when a groupByField is specified. If true, the minority
        (least dominant) or the majority (most dominant) attribute values within each group, within each boundary will
        be calculated.
    percent_shape : Optional bool
        This boolean parameter is applicable only when a groupByField is specified. If set to true, the percentage of
        shape (eg. length for lines) for each unique groupByField value is calculated.
    output_name : Optional string
        Additional properties such as output feature service name.
    context : Optional string
        Additional settings such as processing extent and output spatial reference.

    type for each watershed.Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average
