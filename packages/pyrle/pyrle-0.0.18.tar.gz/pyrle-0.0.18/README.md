# pyrle

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/endrebak/pyrle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/endrebak/pyrle) [![hypothesis tested](graphs/hypothesis-tested-brightgreen.svg)](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyrle.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyrle)

Run length arithmetic in Python using Cython. Inspired by the Rle class in R's
S4Vectors.

As opposed to S4Vectors, pyrle does not rotate the shortest vector, but rather extends the shorter Rle with zeroes. This is likely the desired behavior in almost all cases.

## Develop

```
python build_code.py; python setup.py build_ext --inplace; py.test -f tests/
```

## TODO

- Write tests that generate random vectors and compares the results from pyrle and S4Vectors.
- Fix multithreaded coverage code that does not take option value_col

## Example

```
import numpy as np
from pyrle import Rle
import pandas as pd

r = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=np.int16)
# v = pd.Series([-1, 2.3, 3, 4.976], dtype=np.float)
r1 = Rle(r, r)
r2 = Rle(r * 2, r * 2)

r3 = r1 + r2
print("Runs:", r3.runs)
# Runs: [1 1 1 3 4 2 8]
print("Values:", r3.values)
# Values: [  3.   4.   6.   7.  10.   6.   8.]
# This is the same as we get in R:
# numeric-Rle of length 20 with 7 runs
#   Lengths:  1  1  1  3  4  2  8
#   Values :  3  4  6  7 10  6  8
```
