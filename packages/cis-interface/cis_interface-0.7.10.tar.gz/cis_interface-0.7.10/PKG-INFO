        The CiS framework provides support for combining scientific models
        written in different programming languages. To combine two models,
        modelers add simple communications interfaces to the model code and
        provide simple declarative specification files that identify the models
        that should be run and the inputs and outputs those models expect.
        
        The system uses the specification files to configure the communications
        channels and expose them to the models. The complexity of the particular
        communications system is managed by the framework, which performs
        communication setup, binds the communications to simple interfaces
        within the models, and manages execution of the models. The complexities
        of model registration and discovery, as well as the complexities of
        setup and management of the communications system are handled
        under-the-hood by the framework under direction of the model
        specification, freeing the domain scientist from implementing
        communications protocols or translating models to the same programming
        language.
        
        Please refer to the package
        `documentation <https://cropsinsilico.github.io/cis_interface/>`__ for
        additional information about the package and directions for installing
        it.
        
        .. warning:: This will be the last release of the Crops in Silico 
           framework under the name ``cis_interface``. Moving forward, 
           the package will be refered to as ``yggdrasil``. The new 
           Github repository for ``yggdrasil`` can be found 
           `here <https://github.com/cropsinsilico/yggdrasil>`__ 
           and the new documentation can be found 
           `here <https://cropsinsilico.github.io/yggdrasil/>`__. 
           Future versions of the ``yggdrasil`` package be installed from 
           PyPI via ``pip install yggdrasil-framework``. We apologize for 
           any inconvenince this change causes, but feel the new name 
           better reflects the spirit of the project.
