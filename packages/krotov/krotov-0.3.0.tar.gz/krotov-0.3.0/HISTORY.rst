0.3.0 (2019-03-01)
------------------

* Added: Preprint citation information (``krotov.__arxiv__``, ``krotov.__citation__``, ``krotov.__bibtex__``)
* Added: Ability to continue from a previous optimization (`#26`_)
* Added: Parameter ``out`` to ``print_table`` info-hook
* Added: Parameter ``finalize`` to ``Result.load``
* Added: Ability to dump optimization result every so many iterations (``dump_result`` check-convergence routine)
* Added: `re-entrant` option for ``DensityMatrixODEPropagator``
* Bugfix: Discretize controls to float values (`#41`_)
* Bugfix: Fix overlap for non-Hermitian operators (`#39`_)
* Bugfix: Interface for passing ``tau_vals`` to ``chi_constructor`` (`#36`_)
* Added: function ``above_value`` for convergence check (`#35`_)


0.2.0 (2019-02-14)
------------------

* Added: Implementation of all the standard functionals
* Added: The ``info_hook`` receives additional information, including ∫gₐ(t)dt (`#32`_)
* Added: Initialization of objectives for gate optimization in Liouville space
* Added: A new propagator ``DensityMatrixODEPropagator`` for faster density matrix propagation
* Added: Support for "stateful" propagators by subclassing from ``krotov.propagators.Propagator``
* Changed: more flexibility for parallelization (`#29`_)
* Added: Support for the second-order pulse update
* Changed: The options for the controls (λₐ, update-shape) are now passed through a simplified ``dict`` interface, instead of a custom ``PulseOptions`` class.


0.1.0 (2018-12-24)
------------------

* Initial release with complete implementation of first-order Krotov's method
* Support for state-to-state and gate optimization, for both closed and open systems
