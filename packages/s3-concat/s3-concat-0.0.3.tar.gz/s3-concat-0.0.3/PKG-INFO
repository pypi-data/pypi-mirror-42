Description: Python S3 Concat
        ================
        
        S3 Concat is used to concatenate many small files in an s3 bucket into
        fewer larger files.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        *Comming soon:* :sub:```pip install s3-concat```
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        | This installs a cli called ``s3-concat``. Find out how to use it by
          running ``s3-concat -h``.
        | It can also be imported and used in any other python scripts by foing
          ``import s3_concat``.
        | More docs to follow on that.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        | This uses the multipart upload of s3 and its limits are
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html
        | TODO: give details on how it deals with files smaller then 5MB because
          it is handled differently.
