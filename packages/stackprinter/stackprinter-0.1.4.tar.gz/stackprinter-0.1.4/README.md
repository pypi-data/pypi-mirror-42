## Python stack formatter

Print nicer tracebacks & call stacks, with more source code and the current variable values. This helps a lot when your only available debugging tool is a printout or a log file.

## Installation


```bash
pip install stackprinter
```

## Logging exceptions
Call `set_excepthook()` somewhere to replace the default python crash message:

```python
import stackprinter
stackprinter.set_excepthook(style='color')
```

Call `show` or `format` inside an _except_ block to explicitely see the current exception. `show` prints to stderr, `format` returns a string (for logging). You can also pass previously caught exception objects into these methods.


```python
try:
    something()
except:
    stackprinter.show()  # grab the current exception and print a traceback to stderr

    # ...or only return a string, e.g. for logging.
    message = stackprinter.format()
    logging.log(message)
```

By default, these calls will generate plain text. Pass `style='color'` to get funky terminal colors (a type of [semantic highlighting](https://medium.com/@brianwill/making-semantic-highlighting-useful-9aeac92411df), instead of syntax highlighting). For more configs, [see the docs of `format()`](https://github.com/cknd/stackprinter/blob/master/stackprinter/__init__.py#L28-L137).

## Printing the call stack of another thread
Pass a thread object to `show` or `format`.

```python
thread = threading.Thread(target=something)
thread.start()
while True:
    stackprinter.show(thread) # or format(thread)
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

## Printing the call stack of the current thread
Call `show` or `format` outside of exception handling.

```python
stackprinter.show() # or format()
```

There's also `show_current_stack()`, which does the same thing everywhere, even inside except blocks.

## Tracing a piece of code as it is executed

More for curiosity than anything else, you can watch a piece of code execute step-by-step, printing a trace of all calls & returns 'live' as they are happening. Slows everything down though, of course.
```python
tp = stackprinter.TracePrinter(style='color', suppressed_paths=[r"lib/python.*/site-packages/numpy"])
tp.enable()
a = np.ones(111)
dosomething(a)
tp.disable()
```

# How it works

Basically, this is a frame formatter. For each [frame on the call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack), it grabs the source code to find out which source lines reference which variables. Then it displays code and variables in the neighbourhood of the last executed line.

Since this already requires a map of where each variable occurs in the code, it was difficult to not also implement the whole semantic highlighting color thing seen in the screenshots. The colors are ANSI escape codes now, but it should be fairly straightforward™ to render the underlying data without any 1980ies terminal technology. Say, a foldable and clickable HTML page with downloadable pickled variables. For now you'll have to pipe the ANSI strings through [ansi2html](https://github.com/ralphbean/ansi2html/) or something.

# Caveats

This displays variable values as they are _at the time of formatting_. In
multi-threaded programs, variables can change while we're busy walking
the stack & printing them. So, if nothing seems to make sense, consider that
your exception and the traceback messages are from slightly different times.
Sadly, there is no responsible way to freeze all other threads as soon
as we want to inspect some thread's call stack (...or is there?)

# Docs

\*coughs\*

For now, just look at all the doc strings, [e.g. those of `format()`](https://github.com/cknd/stackprinter/blob/master/stackprinter/__init__.py#L28-L137)
