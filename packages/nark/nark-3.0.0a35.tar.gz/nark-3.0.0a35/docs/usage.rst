.. |nark| replace:: ``nark``
.. _nark: https://github.com/hotoffthehamster/nark

To use nark in a project, import it into your project::

    import nark

You can play around with items without setting anything up,
but to be useful, you'll want to setup a basic config to tell
|nark|_ where to store items that you want to persist.

Wire something along the lines of:

.. code-block:: Python

   import nark

   nark_config = {
      'db_engine' = 'sqlite',
      'db_path' = 'path/to/nark.sqlite',
   }
   controller = nark.control.NarkControl(nark_config)
   controller.standup_store()

Now you can read from the data store, e.g.,

.. code-block:: Python

   records = controller.facts.get_all()

As well as being able to write to it, e.g.,

.. code-block:: Python

   fact = nark.items.Fact()
   controller.facts.save(fact)

This is just a taste of the action.

Because code will naturally outpace any effort to document it, please
refer to the docstrings documentation in the source for more information.

Or, better yet, look at the code for the reference client, ``dob``,
to see how best to work with |nark|_. Start by reading the
`class Controller
<https://github.com/landonb/dob/blob/develop/dob/controller.py>`__,
which descends from ``nark.NarkControl``
and runs through the complete setup process.
