        # Getting Involved
        
        NuCypher is a community-driven project and we're very open to outside contributions.
        
        All our development discussions happen in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7rmXa3S), where we're happy to answer technical questions, discuss feature requests,
        and accept bug reports.
        
        If you're interested in contributing code, please check out our [Contribution Guide](https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/guides/contribution_guide.html)
        and browse our [Open Issues](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues) for potential areas to contribute.
        
        # Security
        
        If you identify vulnerabilities with _any_ nucypher code, please email security@nucypher.com with relevant information to your findings.
        We will work with researchers to coordinate vulnerability disclosure between our stakers, partners, and users to ensure successful mitigation of vulnerabilities.
        
        Throughout the reporting process, we expect researchers to honor an embargo period that may vary depending on the severity of the disclosure.
        This ensures that we have the opportunity to fix any issues, identify further issues (if any), and inform our users.
        
        Sometimes vulnerabilities are of a more sensitive nature and require extra precautions.
        We are happy to work together to use a more secure medium, such as Signal.
        Email security@nucypher.com and we will coordinate a communication channel that we're both comfortable with.
        
        A great place to begin your research is by working on our testnet.
        Please see our [documentation](https://docs.nucypher.com) to get started.
        We ask that you please respect testnet machines and their owners.
        If you find a vulnerability that you suspect has given you access to a machine against the owner's permission, stop what you're doing and immediately email security@nucypher.com.
