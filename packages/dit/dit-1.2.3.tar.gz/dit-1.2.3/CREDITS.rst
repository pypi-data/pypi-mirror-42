Contributions
=============

This file contains an incomplete list of people who have contributed to ``dit``.
It is intended to be an *inclusive* list, and anyone who has contributed and wishes 
to make that contribution known is welcome to add an entry into this file.  As a 
rule, no name should be added to this list without the approval of the person
associated with that name.

In general, creating a comprehensive list of contributors can be difficult, and
the list within this file is almost certainly incomplete. Contributors include
testers, bug reporters, people who wish to remain anonymous, funding sources, 
academic advisors, end users, and even build/integration systems (such as 
`TravisCI <https://travis-ci.org>`_, `coveralls <https://coveralls.io>`_, and 
`readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_).

Do you want to make your contribution known? If you have commit access, edit
this file and add your name. If you do not have commit access, feel free to open
an `issue <https://github.com/dit/dit/issues/new>`_ or get in contact with one
of the official team `members <https://github.com/dit?tab=members>`_.

A supplementary (but still incomplete) list of contributors is given by the list
of names that have commits in ``dit``'s `git <http://git-scm.com>`_ repository.
This can be obtained via::

    git log --raw | grep "^Author: " | sort | uniq
