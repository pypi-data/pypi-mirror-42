        Motivation for development
        --------------------------
        Having been involved with the setup of Identity Providers which use open LDAP as the authentication backend, I am yet to
        come across a FOSS solution for signing up users that provides a way for them to reset their passwords on their own.
        This has been a pain point when setting up identity providers because the only alternative an admin has is to login to
        the backend and manually reset their passwords.
        There is a commercial solution (ldap-account-manager) which I haven't tried and that is my main motivation to build an
        open solution. I haven't bothered with building an interface to manage LDAP since that already exists and I recommend
        phpldapadmin (FOSS) for that.
