Description: 
        Megatron is a framework for building computation graphs for
        feature engineering in machine learning, with Numpy arrays as the data type.
        Use Megatron if you want to:
            - Do feature engineering in a modular and functional way, building up features one step at a time
            - Use disk space to save time by caching feature sets for easy reloading
            - Train feature engineering modules on training data and apply them to testing data
            - Write custom functions for complex transformations, but access built-in functions for quick and common transformations
            - Build feature engineering like you build Keras models (the API is heavily inspired by Keras)
        Or any combination of these.
        Megatron is distributed under the MIT license.
