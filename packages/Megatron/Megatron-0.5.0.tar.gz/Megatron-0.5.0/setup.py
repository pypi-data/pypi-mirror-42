Megatron is a framework for building computation graphs for
feature engineering in machine learning, with Numpy arrays as the data type.
Use Megatron if you want to:
    - Do feature engineering in a modular and functional way, building up features one step at a time
    - Use disk space to save time by caching feature sets for easy reloading
    - Train feature engineering modules on training data and apply them to testing data
    - Write custom functions for complex transformations, but access built-in functions for quick and common transformations
    - Build feature engineering like you build Keras models (the API is heavily inspired by Keras)
Or any combination of these.
Megatron is distributed under the MIT license.
