    A reverse dictionary. Inverts a mapping from (key: value) to (value: [keys]).

    Since normal dictionaries can have multiple keys that map to the same value (many-to-one),
    reverse dictionaries must necessarily be some sort of one-to-many mapping.
    This means each entry must be a list. This class adds methods that manage those lists.

    Naming conventions are reversed - in a reverse dictionary, we look up a value to get a list
    of keys that would map to it in the forward dictionary.
