    Base component communications class for the Spectra program. Routes messages and data structures between
    the application, the GUI, and all other constituent components. Has mappings for every command to a list
    of registered functions along with where to send the return value. Since the command dictionary may not
    be mutated after creation and all execution state is kept within the call stack, multiple threads may
    run off the same engine object.
