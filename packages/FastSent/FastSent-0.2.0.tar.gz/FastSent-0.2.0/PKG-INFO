Description: FastSent is Sentiment Classification python library. It uses Sequential model for Sentiment classfication. FastSent is developed using GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) model.
        
        Requirement
        ------------
        
        FastSent support Python 3.6 or newer.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            pip install FastSent
        
        Example
        -------------
        
        This package is being developed for sentiment classfication using Sequential model GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit).
        
        	data = 'Sample.csv'
        	labels = 'sentiment'
        	text = 'content'
        
        	f = FastSent()
        	X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = f.train_test_split(data, labels, text)
        	trained_model = f.fit_train(X_train, y_train, 500, 50, 7789, 5, 4)
        	prediction = f.predict(trained_model, X_test, y_train, 4)
        
        
        
        
        where ``sample`` is a training file containing labels and text.
