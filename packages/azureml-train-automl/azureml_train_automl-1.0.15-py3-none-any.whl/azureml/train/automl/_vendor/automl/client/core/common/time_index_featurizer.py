    """
    A transformation class for computing (mostly categorical) features.

    .. py:class:: TimeIndexFeaturizer

    .. _Wikipedia.ISO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date

    This is intended to be used as a featurization step inside the
    forecast pipeline.

    This transform returns a new TimeSeriesDataFrame with all the
    original columns, plus extra 18 columns with datetime-based features.
    The following features are created:
    * year - calendar year
    * year_iso - ISO year, see details later
    * half - half-year, 1 if date is prior to July 1, 2 otherwise
    * quarter - calendar quarter, 1 through 4
    * month - calendar month, 1 through 12
    * month_lbl - calendar month as string, 'January' through 'December'
    * day - calendar day of month, 1 through 31
    * hour - hour of day, 0 through 23
    * minute - minute of day, 0 through 59
    * second - second of day, 0 through 59
    * am_pm - 0 if hour is before noon (12 pm), 1 otherwise
    * am_pm_lbl - 'am' if hour is before noon (12 pm), 'pm' otherwise
    * hour12 - hour of day on a 12 basis, without the AM/PM piece
    * wday - day of week, 0 (Monday) through 6 (Sunday)
    * wday_lbl - day of week as string
    * qday - day of quarter, 1 through 92
    * yday - day of year, 1 through 366
    * week - ISO week, see below for details

    ISO year and week are defined in ISO 8601, see Wikipedia.ISO for details.
    In short, ISO weeks always start on Monday and last 7 days.
    ISO years start on the first week of year that has a Thursday.
    This means if January 1 falls on a Friday, ISO year will begin only on
    January 4. As such, ISO years may differ from calendar years.

    :param overwrite_columns:
        Flag that permits the transform to overwrite existing columns in the
        input TimeSeriesDataFrame for features that are already present in it.
        If True, prints a warning and overwrites columns.
        If False, throws a RuntimeError.
        Defaults to False to protect user data.
        Full list of columns that will be created is stored in the
        FEATURE_COLUMN_NAMES attribute.
    :type overwrite_columns: boolean
    :param prune_features:
        Flag that calls the method to prune obviously useless features.
        The following pruning strategies are employed:
            1. Discards all 'string' features, such as ``month_lbl``.
            2. If input TimeSeriesDataFrame's time index has only dates, and
             no time component, all hour/minute/etc features are removed.
            3. Any features with zero variance in them are removed.
            4. Finally, correlation matrix is constructed for all remaining
             features. From each pair such that the absolute value of
             cross-correlation across features exceeds ``correlation_cutoff``
             one of the features is discarded. Example is quarter of year and
             month of year for quarterly time series data - these two features
             are perfectly correlated.
    :type prune_features: boolean
    :param correlation_cutoff:
        If ``prune_features`` is ``True``, features that have
        ``abs(correlation)`` of ``correlation_cutoff`` or higher will be
        discarded. For example, for quarterly time series both quarter of
        year and month of year can be constructed, but they will be perfectly
        correlated. Only one of these features will be preserved.
        Note that ``correlation_cutoff`` must be between 0 and 1, signs of
        correlations are discarded. Correlation with target is not computed
        to avoid overfitting and target leaks. Default value is 0.99, which
        preserves most features, lower values will prune features more
        aggressively.
