Python implementation of the Happy Eyeballs Algorithm described in `RFC 6555 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555>`_.
Provided with a single file and dead-simple API to allow easy vendoring
and integration into other projects.

Abstract
--------

When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's
IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client
application experiences significant connection delay compared to an
IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual-
stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document
specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible
delay and provides an algorithm.

~ `Abstract from RFC 6555 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555>`_

Installation
------------

``$ python -m pip install rfc6555``

Usage
-----

The main API for the ``rfc6555`` module is via ``rfc6555.create_connection()`` which
functions identically to ``socket.create_connection()`` with the same arguments.
This function will automatically fall back on a ``socket.create_connection()`` call if
RFC 6555 is not supported (for instance on platforms not capable of IPv6) or if
RFC 6555 is disabled via setting ``rfc6555.RFC6555_ENABLED`` equal to ``False``.

**IMPORTANT:** Caching is **NOT** thread-safe by default. If you require thread-safe caching
one should create their own implementation of ``rfc6555._RFC6555CacheManager`` object that
is thread-safe and assign an instance to ``rfc6555.cache``.

 .. code-block:: python

  import rfc6555
  sock = rfc6555.create_connection(('www.google.com', 80), timeout=10, source_address=('::1', 0))

  # This will disable the Happy Eyeballs algorithm for future
  # calls to create_connection()
  rfc6555.RFC6555_ENABLED = False

  # Use this to set a different duration for cache entries.
  rfc6555.cache.validity_duration = 10  # 10 second validity time.

  # Use this to disable caching.
  rfc6555.cache.enabled = False

Support
-------

This module supports Python 2.6 or newer and supports all major platforms.
Additionally if you have ``selectors2>=2.0.0`` installed this module will
also support Jython in addition to CPython.
