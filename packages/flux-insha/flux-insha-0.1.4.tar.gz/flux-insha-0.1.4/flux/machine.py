class StateMachine:
    '''The class provides an interface for modeling a state machine. The state machine 
    supports the registration of an arbitrary number of states and events that trigger 
    transitions between the states.

    When a state machine is activated, the following callbacks are invoked:

    #. Initial State: ``will_enter_state``: The callback set on the ``initial_state`` is invoked.
    #. The ``current_state`` changes from ``None`` to ``initial_state``.
    #. Initial State: ``did_enter_state``: The callback set on the ``initial_state`` is invoked.

    Each time an event is fired, the following callbacks are invoked:

    #. ``should_fire_event``: The callback set on the event being fired is consulted to determine if the event can be fired. If ``False`` is returned then the event is declined and no further callbacks are invoked
    #. ``will_fire_event``: The callback set on the event being fired is invoked.
    #. ``will_exit_state`` (Old State): The callback set on the outgoing state is invoked.
    #. ``will_enter_state`` (New State): The callback set on the incoming state is invoked.
    #. The ``current_state`` changes from the old state to the new state.
    #. ``did_exit_state`` (Old State): The callback set on the old state is invoked.
    #. ``did_enter_state`` (New State): The callback set on the new current state is invoked.
    #. ``did_fire_event``: The callback set on the event being fired is invoked.
