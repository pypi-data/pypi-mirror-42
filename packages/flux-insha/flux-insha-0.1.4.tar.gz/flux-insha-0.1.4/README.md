# Flux: A State Machine

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/badges/dev/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/commits/dev) [![coverage report](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/badges/dev/coverage.svg)](https://gitlab.com/insha/Flux/commits/dev)

Flux is a lightweight library that provides an API for implementing a state machine in 
Python. It is a work-in-progress, but has some really cool features (see below) and unit tested.

State machines are a great way to manage complexity in your application and Flux provides 
you with an elegant API for implementing state machines in your project.

## Features
- Supports an arbitrary number of States and Events.
- States and Events support callbacks for responding to state transitions.
- Transitions support the inclusion of arbitrary user data, making it easy to broadcast metadata across callbacks.
- No dependencies for normal usage.

## Installation

From the cheese shop:

    pip install Flux

From source:

    pip install -e .

## Usage

A simple definition of a state machine is that any *machine* that has a set of *states* and *events* (also referred to as *transitions*) defined between them. The state machine pattern **enforces** only events that are allowed in the particular state can be triggered. However, this requires us to spend a bit of time upfront figuring out what are our states and which events can be triggered from these states.

Here, we are going to create a simple water bottle filling machine. There are three states, Waiting, Filling, Done. There are three events that lets us transition from one state to the next. A diagram of this state machine looks like:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Waiting --> Filling;
    Filling --> Done;
    Done --> Waiting;
```

We start by importing in the main components of Flux:

```python
from flux.machine import StateMachine
from flux.state import State, StateInfo
from flux.event import Event, EventCallback
from flux.errors import StateMachineError, StateMachineEventError, StateMachineStateError
```

```python
# Callbacks for states
def did_enter_state(transition):
    print(f'==> FSM::Did enter {transition.destination_state}')

def did_exit_state(transition):
    print(f'<== FSM::Did exit {transition.source_state}')

def will_enter_state(transition):
    print(f'--> FSM::Will enter {transition.destination_state} from {transition.source_state}')

def will_exit_state(transition):
    print(f'<-- FSM::Will exit {transition.source_state}')

# Callbacks for events
def did_fire_event(transition):
    print(f'=> FSM::Did fire {transition.event} in state {transition.source_state}')

def will_fire_event(transition):
    print(f'=> FSM::Will fire {transition.event} in state {transition.source_state}')

# State configuration
waiting = State(name='waiting', info=StateInfo(did_enter_state=did_enter_state, 
                                               did_exit_state=did_exit_state,

                                               will_exit_state=will_exit_state))
