    Handle undiscriminated unions of the form ``Union[A, B, C, D]`` by inspecting the
    inner types one by one.

    This is the "implicit discriminant" technique, exploiting the fact that Python
    already tags all values with their type.

    A potential problem is that the JSON structure may not retain that information. So
    another rule could attempt to add a discriminant to the JSON data. For example, if
    you had two ``attrs`` style classes, they could add a `type` field with the class
    name. As there are many ways to do that, this rule doesn't attempt to pick one for
    you.

    Note: The optional rule handles the common case of ``Union[T, NoneType]`` more
    efficiently, so it should be before this.
