Description: # BlurWal
        
        A background application that smoothly blurs your wallpaper when a given
        number of windows is opened.
        
        
        ## Example

        ## Feature(s)
        
        BlurWal will first generate transition frames for the current wallpaper,
        with each of them being an increasingly blurred version. When you then open
        a given number of windows, these frames will be set as your wallpaper in
        quick succession, giving the effect of a smooth blur transition. When the
        number of open windows goes below the threshold again, the transition will
        run in reverse and consequently unblur the wallpaper.
        
        **tl;dr:** A sleek-looking blur effect for your minimal desktop's wallpaper.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Requirements
        
        * `Python 3.6+`
        * `ImageMagick` (*for generating transition frames*)
        * `feh` (*for setting the wallpaper*)
        
        ### From PyPI repository
        
        ```shell
        pip install --user blurwal
        ```
        
        ### Manually via Git clone
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://gitlab.com/BVollmerhaus/blurwal
        cd blurwal
        pip install --user .
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Simply run `blurwal` and it will regenerate its transition frames and blur
        on the appropriate window events.
        
        
        ### Options
        
        This list includes only the interesting options – run `blurwal -h` for a
        complete list and further information.
        
        | Option | Description |
        | ------ | ----------- |
        | `-m`, `--min`    | The minimum number of windows to blur the wallpaper (default: 2)
        | `-s`, `--steps`  | The number of steps in a blur transition (default: 10, minimum: 2)
        | `-b`, `--blur`   | The blur strength (sigma) to use when fully blurred (default: 10)
        | `-i`, `--ignore` | A space-separated list of window classes to exclude
