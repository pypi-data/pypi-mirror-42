Description: AWS ParallelCluster is an AWS supported Open Source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and
        manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS cloud.
        Built on the Open Source CfnCluster project, AWS ParallelCluster enables you to quickly build an HPC compute environment in AWS.
        It automatically sets up the required compute resources and a shared filesystem and offers a variety of batch schedulers such as AWS Batch, SGE, Torque, and Slurm.
        AWS ParallelCluster facilitates both quick start proof of concepts (POCs) and production deployments.
        You can build higher level workflows, such as a Genomics portal that automates the entire DNA sequencing workflow, on top of AWS ParallelCluster.
        
            usage: pcluster [-h]
                            {create,update,delete,start,stop,status,list,instances,ssh,configure,version,createami}
                            ...
        
            pcluster is a tool to launch and manage a cluster.
        
            positional arguments:
              {create,update,delete,start,stop,status,list,instances,ssh,configure,version,createami}
                create              creates a cluster
                update              update a running cluster
                delete              delete a cluster
                start               start the compute fleet that has been stopped
                stop                stop the compute fleet, but leave the master server running for debugging/development
                status              pull the current status of the cluster
                list                display a list of stacks associated with AWS ParallelCluster
                instances           display a list of all instances in a cluster
                ssh                 connect to the master server using SSH
                configure           creating initial AWS ParallelCluster configuration
                version             display version of AWS ParallelCluster
                createami           (Linux/OSX) create a custom AMI to use with AWS ParallelCluster
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
            For command specific flags run pcluster [command] --help
