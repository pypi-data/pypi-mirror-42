        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pycp`` works both for any version greater than Python 3.4, and is installable with
        ``pip``.
        
        
        For ``Archlinux,`` a ``PKGBUILD`` is also available on ``AUR``
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        * Implementation heavily inspired by the wonderful library ``progressbar`` by Nilton Volpato.
        
        * I also maintain a similary tool written in rust called `rusync <https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/rusync>`_. It has a different set of features (so you may want to stick with pycpy), but is much faster.
        
        * If you are looking for a ncurses-based solution, vcp maybe the right choice
          for you http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/sysutils/vcp.html
        
        * If you are looking for a more general solution to display progress bars when
          performing command-line operations, see clpbar: http://clpbar.sourceforge.net/
