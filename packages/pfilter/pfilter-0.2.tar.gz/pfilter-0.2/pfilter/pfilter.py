                a function that generates N samples from the prior over internal states, as

        observe_fn : function(states) => observations
                    transformation function from the internal state to the sensor state. Takes an (N,D) array of states 
                    and returns the expected sensor output as an array (e.g. a (N,W,H) tensor if generating W,H dimension images).
        n_particles : int 
                     number of particles in the filter
        dynamics_fn : function(states) => states
                      dynamics function, which takes an (N,D) state array and returns a new one with the dynamics applied.
        noise_fn : function(states) => states
                    noise function, takes a state vector and returns a new one with noise added.
        weight_fn :  function(real, hypothesized) => weights
                    computes the distance from the real sensed variable and that returned by observe_fn. Takes
                    a an array of N hypothesised sensor outputs (e.g. array of dimension (N,W,H)) and the observed output (e.g. array of dimension (W,H)) and 
                    returns a strictly positive weight for the each hypothesis as an N-element vector. 
                    This should be a *similarity* measure, with higher values meaning more similar, for example from an RBF kernel.
        internal_weight_fn :  function(states, observed) => weights
                    Reweights the particles based on their *internal* state. This is function which takes
                    an (N,D) array of internal states and the observation and 
                    returns a strictly positive weight for the each state as an N-element vector.
