# Statick ROS-M Upload Plugin

The Statick ROS-M Upload Plugin is a plugin for Statick to generate output compatible with the ROS-M registry.
You should only care about this plugin if you are involved with the ROS-M registry.

## Additions to Statick
This plugin introduces a new reporting plugin to Statick.
The plugin should be automatically detected the next time you run Statick.

## Use Cases
This plugin generates a .json file which can be manually uploaded to the ROS-M registry.
Future work will add support for automatically uploading to the registry.
