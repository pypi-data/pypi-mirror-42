creapy CLI
~~~~~~~~~~
`creapy` is a convenient CLI utility that enables you to manage your wallet, transfer funds, check
balances and more.

Using the Wallet
----------------
`creapy` lets you leverage your BIP38 encrypted wallet to perform various actions on your accounts.

The first time you use `creapy`, you will be prompted to enter a password. This password will be used to encrypt
the `creapy` wallet, which contains your private keys.

You can change the password via `changewalletpassphrase` command.

::

    creapy changewalletpassphrase


From this point on, every time an action requires your private keys, you will be prompted ot enter
this password (from CLI as well as while using `crea` library).

To bypass password entry, you can set an environment variable ``UNLOCK``.

::

    UNLOCK=mysecretpassword creapy transfer <recipient_name> 100 CREA

Common Commands
---------------
First, you may like to import your Crea account:

::

    creapy importaccount


You can also import individual private keys:

::

   creapy addkey <private_key>

Listing accounts:

::

   creapy listaccounts

Show balances:

::

   creapy balance account_name1 account_name2

Sending funds:

::

   creapy transfer --account <account_name> <recipient_name> 100 CREA memo

Upvoting a post:

::

   creapy upvote --account <account_name> https://creary.net/funny/@mynameisbrian/the-content-stand-a-comic


Setting Defaults
----------------
For a more convenient use of ``creapy`` as well as the ``crea`` library, you can set some defaults.
This is especially useful if you have a single Crea account.

::

   creapy set default_account test
   creapy set default_vote_weight 100

   creapy config
    +---------------------+--------+
    | Key                 | Value  |
    +---------------------+--------+
    | default_account     | test   |
    | default_vote_weight | 100    |
    +---------------------+--------+

If you've set up your `default_account`, you can now send funds by omitting this field:

::

    creapy transfer <recipient_name> 100 CREA memo

--------
