============
Code Metrics
============

Mine your SCM for insight on your software. A work of love
inspired by `Adam Tornhill`_'s books.

Code metrics is a simple Python module that leverage your source control
management (SCM) tool to generate insight on your code base.

- pandas_: for data munching.
- lizard_: for code complexity calculation.
- cloc.pl (script): for line counts from cloc_
- For now, only Subversion and git are supported.


Installation
------------

To install codemetrics, simply use pip:

::

  pip install codemetrics



Usage
-----

This is a simple tool that makes it easy to retrieve information from your
Source Control Management (SCM) repository and hopefully gain insight from it.

::

  import codemetrics as cm
  import cm.git

  log_df = cm.git.get_git_log()
  ages_df = cm.get_ages(log_df)
