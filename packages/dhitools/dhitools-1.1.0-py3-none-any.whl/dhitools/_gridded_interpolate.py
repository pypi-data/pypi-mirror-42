"""
Gridded interpolation applied to dfsu unstructured mesh. Allows you to
downsample large mesh/dfsu files to something more manageable.

This improves scipy.interpolate.griddata as it computes the interpolation
weights (which don't change) rather than calculating the weights for each
point interpolation.
