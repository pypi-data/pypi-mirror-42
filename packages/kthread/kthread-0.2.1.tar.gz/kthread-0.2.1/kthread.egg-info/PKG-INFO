Description: # kthread
        Killable threads in Python! 
        
        ## Purpose
        The built-in `threading.Thread` class offers no simple solution to terminate a running thread.  `kthread.KThread` inherits `threading.Thread` and supplies methods named `exit()`, `kill()`, and `terminate()` that serve the same purpose: attempt to stop a thread if it's running.
        
        ## How it works
        KThread leverages the CPython API to raise a `SystemExit` exception on a given thread.  Assuming that the thread is not blocked by an operating system call (such as `sleep`, `accept`, or `recv`), the thread will forcefully quit.

            >>> def func():
            >>>     try:
            >>>         while True:
            >>>             time.sleep(0.2)
            >>>     finally:
            >>>         print "Greetings from Vice City!"
            >>>
            >>> t = kthread.KThread(target = func, name = "KillableThread1")
            >>> t.start()
            >>> t.isAlive()
            True
            >>> t.terminate()
            Greetings from Vice City!
            >>> t.isAlive()
            False
