"""
biosignalsnotebooks module responsible for loading data from the available signal samples (used on
biosignalsnotebooks Notebooks).

Available Functions
-------------------
[Public]

load_signal
    Function that returns a dictionary with the data contained inside a signal sample file
    (stored in the biosignalsnotebooks signal samples directory).

[Private]

_generate_download_google_link
    Google Drive sharable links do not allow a direct download with wget function, so, this private
    function manipulates the input link to ensure the desired download.
