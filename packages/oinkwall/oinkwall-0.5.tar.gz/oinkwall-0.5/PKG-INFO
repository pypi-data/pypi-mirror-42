Description: python-oinkwall
        ===============
        
        Oinkwall is a python library that provides a highly programmable way to
        help you to generate low level Linux IPTables rule files and hosts.allow
        rules. It aims at handling the boring parts (resolving domain names,
        putting the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the right place) for you, while
        it completely leaves you with the freedom to use raw iptables commands
        as much as possible.
        
        Unlike most firewall tools, it does not try to impose using any higher
        level abstractions on you. It operates on the level that programs like
        iptables-save and iptables-restore work on. It simply helps you to
        easier organize your iptables rules, if you like writing them directly
        and adding them together programmatically.
        
        The library can be used to assemble a firewall for a single host or
        router, or for generating a lot of them, as building your own templating
        system or higher level tools 100% tailored to your own specific
        situation and your low level rule needs should be pretty easy.
