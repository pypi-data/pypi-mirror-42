        Cronohub
        ========
        
        Archive from anywhere to anywhere using the power of plugins.
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        Cronohub in it's own is useless. It's power comes from plugins located here
        plugins_repository_. These plugins are used as **source** and **target**.
        Examples are under the plugins_ sections. Once an appropriate plugin is
        selected for downloading and uploading, cronohub takes care of the rest.
        
        For example to download all repositories for a user from github and then
        upload all those repositories to an s3 bucket with timestamp cronohub would
        be used like this:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            cronohub -s github -t s3
        
        The github plugin takes care of all of the necessary authentication and
        parallel downloading of all repositories. The plugin also has the ability
        to filter out repos that the user whishes to archive. It's all based on
        the plugin. For more information, locate the plugin and read it's README.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        Installation is simply calling:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install cronohub
        
        
        Usage

        Plugins
        =======
        
        The plugins are the soul of cronohub. They are constantly added and can be
        very specific and for a single purpose or can be for a wider audience.
        Cronohub only provides a platform for all these plugins to exist and work
        together. Cronohub is a mediator in this case.
        
        For more information please read the plugin's readme section that explains
        how they work and how a new one can be added and where they need to be
        located in order or cronohub the pick them up.
