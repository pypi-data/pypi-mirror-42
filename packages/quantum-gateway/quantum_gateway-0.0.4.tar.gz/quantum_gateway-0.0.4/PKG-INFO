Description: # Query a Quantum Gateway
        
        This library allows a Verizon FiOS Quantum Gateway to be queried. It uses the `requests` library to authenticate, log in, and query the web interface of the gateway.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Please note as of the Firmware version 02.02.00.13 and UI version v1.0.388 https is the only way to get to the admin console. This is using a self signed cert as well. The code now defaults to https and ignores the self signed cert warning.
        
        ```python
        # Import
        from quantum_gateway import QuantumGatewayScanner
        
        # Connect to gateway via HTTPS
        gateway = QuantumGatewayScanner('192.168.1.1', 'your_password_here')
        
        # Or, connect to gateway via HTTP
        gateway = QuantumGatewayScanner('192.168.1.1', 'your_password_here', False)
        
        # Property is set to True if we successfully logged in, otherwise False
        gateway.success_init
        
        # Get list of all connected devices' MAC addresses
        gateway.scan_devices()
        
        # Get specific device's name
        gateway.get_device_name('mac address of device here')
        ```
