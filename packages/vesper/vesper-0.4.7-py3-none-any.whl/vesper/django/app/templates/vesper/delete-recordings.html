    <h2>Delete Recordings</h2>

    <p>
        Deletes recordings from this archive. The recordings are specified as a
        set of stations and a range of dates. All data associated with the
        recordings, except for the recording audio files if present, are deleted
        from the archive, including recording metadata, clips (including clip
        audio files), and annotations. The deletion runs as a Vesper job. This
        operation cannot be undone, so be careful!
    </p>
