    <h2>Delete Clips</h2>

    <p>
        Deletes clips from this archive. The clips are specified as a set of
        detectors, a set of station/mic pairs, a classification, and a range
        of dates. All data associated with the clips, including their audio
        files and annotations, are deleted. You can optionally specify a
        number of clips to retain. The retained clips are selected at random
        from those specified, with all clips equally likely to be retained.
        The deletion runs as a Vesper job. This operation cannot be undone,
        so be careful!
    </p>
