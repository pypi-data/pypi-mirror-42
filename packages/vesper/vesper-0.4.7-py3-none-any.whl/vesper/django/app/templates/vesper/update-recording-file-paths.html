    <h2>Update Recording File Paths</h2>

    <p>
        Updates all of the recording file paths of this archive. For each
        recording file of the archive database, this command attempts to
        locate the file by name in the archive's recording directories.
        If the file is found, its path is updated in the archive database.
        If the file is not found, an error message is logged and the path
        stored for it in the archive database is not modified.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The recording directories of an archive can be specified in the
        <code>recording_directories</code> setting of the
        <code>Archive Settings.yaml</code> file, located in the archive
        directory. If that file is absent, or if it does not contain a
        <code>recording_directories</code> settings, Vesper assumes that
        recordings are located in the <code>Recordings</code> subdirectory
        of the archive directory.
    </p>
