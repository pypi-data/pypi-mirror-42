Deprecated YAML utility functions.

Use of this module is deprecated since it modifies the behavior of the
`yaml` module (in particular the `yaml.load` function) in a way that,
while desirable for the purposes of some modules, may not be desirable
for the purposes of others.

#     Constructor for timestamps that uses `dateutil.parser.parse`.
#     
#     There are two problems with the default PyYAML timestamp constructor:
#     
#     1. It yields either a `datetime.date` object or a `datetime.datetime`
#        object, depending on the parsed text. I would like for the constructor
#        to always yield a `datetime.datetime` object.
#        
#     2. When it yields a `datetime.datetime` object, the object is always
#        naive: any time zone information provided in the parsed string is
#        ignored.
#        
#     These problems are resolved with this timestamp constructor. The
#     constructor always returns a `datetime.datetime` object, and it
#     returns a UTC time when the parsed text includes time zone information.
#     The time zone of the UTC time is `pytz.utc`.
