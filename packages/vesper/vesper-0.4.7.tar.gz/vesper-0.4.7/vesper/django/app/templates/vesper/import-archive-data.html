    <h2>Import Archive Data</h2>

    <p>
        Imports archive data represented as YAML text.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The text can describe
        stations, devices (such as microphones and recorders), which devices
        were used at which stations during which time periods, and how the
        devices were connected (for example, which microphones were connected
        to which recorder channels). It can also processors and annotations.
        [Need to describe archive data YAML format in more detail, perhaps
        on another page that we link to here.]
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can drag and drop a YAML file to the text area below to set the
        contents of the text area to the contents of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
        The import runs as a Vesper job.
