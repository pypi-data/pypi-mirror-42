    <h2>Adjust Clips</h2>

    <p>
        Adjusts the durations and/or start indices of clips of this
        archive. The clips to be adjusted are specified as a set of
        detectors, a set of station/mic pairs, a classification, and
        a range of dates. The durations of the clips are set to the
        specified duration (you can omit the duration to leave clip
        durations as they are). The center indices of the clips with
        the specified annotation are adjusted to match the annotation
        value (you can omit the annotation name to leave clip centers
        as they are). The operation runs as a Vesper job. It cannot be
        undone, so be careful!
    </p>
