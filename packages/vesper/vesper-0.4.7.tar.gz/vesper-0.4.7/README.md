Vesper
======

Vesper is open source software for acoustical monitoring of nocturnal bird migration.

The goal of the Vesper project is to create software that will enable researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory birds at spatial scales ranging from local to continental.

Vesper is a web application. As such, it comprises two parts, a *server* and a *client*. The server stores and processes audio data and metadata while the client runs in a web browser to provide the user interface. The server and client can run on the same computer for personal or small group use, or the server can run on a separate computer and serve multiple clients for larger deployments.

Vesper is not ready for widespread use just yet, but for the intrepid there are preliminary [installation instructions](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/wiki/Installing-and-Updating-Vesper).

Many thanks to [MPG Ranch](http://mpgranch.com), Project Night Flight, [Old Bird](http://oldbird.org), and an anonymous donor for financial support of the Vesper project.
