"""GraphQL over WebSockets implementation with subscriptions.

This module contains implementation of GraphQL WebSocket protocol. The
implementation bases on the Graphene and the Channels 2.

The `Subscription` class itself is a "creative" copy of `Mutation` class
from the Graphene (`graphene/types/mutation.py`).

The `GraphqlWsConsumer` is a Channels WebSocket consumer which maintains
WebSocket connection with the client.

Implementation assumes that client uses the protocol implemented by the
library `subscription-transport-ws` (which is used by Apollo).
"""

# NOTE: The motivation is that currently there is no viable Python-based
# GraphQL subscriptions implementation out of the box. Hopefully there
# is a promising GraphQL WS https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws
# library by the Graphene authors. In particular this pull request
# https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws/pull/9 gives a hope that
# implementation in the current file can be replaced with GraphQL WS one
# day.

class Subscription(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Subscription type definition.

    Subclass this class to define a GraphQL subscription. The class
    works with `GraphqlWsConsumer` which maintains a WebSocket
    connection with the client.

    The subclass specifies the following methods. You can define each of
    them as a `@classmethod`, as a `@staticmethod`, or even as a regular
    method (like Graphene typically does). It shall work fine either
    way. NOTE, if you define the method as a regular method (not a
    classmethod or a staticmethod) you will receive the first argument
    (`payload`/`root`) into the `self` argument.

        publish(payload, info, *args, **kwds):
            This method invoked each time subscription "triggers".
            Raising an exception here will lead to sending the
            notification with the error. To suppress the notification
            return `Subscription.SKIP`.
            Required.

            Args:
                payload: The `payload` from the `broadcast` invocation.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.
            Returns:
                The same the any Graphene resolver returns. Returning
                a special object `Subscription.SKIP` indicates that this
                notification shall not be sent to the client at all.

        subscribe(root, info, *args, **kwds):
            Called when client subscribes. Define this to do some extra
            work when client subscribes and to group subscriptions into
            different subscription groups. Method signature is the same
            as in other GraphQL "resolver" methods but it may return
            the subscription groups names to put the subscription into.
            Optional.

            Args:
                root: Root resolver object. Typically `None`.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.

            Returns:
                The list or tuple of subscription group names this
                subscription instance belongs to. Later the subscription
                will trigger on publishes to any of that groups. If method
                returns None (default behavior) then the subscription is
                only put to the default group (the one which corresponds to
                the `Subscription` subclass).

        unsubscribed(root, info, *args, **kwds):
            Called when client unsubscribes. Define this to be notified
            when client unsubscribes. Optional.

            Args:
                root: Always `None`.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.

    The methods enlisted above receives "standard" set of GraphQL
    resolver arguments. The `info` field has `context` which can be used
    to transmit some useful payload between these methods. For example
    if `subscribe` sets `info.context.zen=42` then `publish` will have
    access to this value as `info.context.zen`.

    Static methods of subscription subclass:
        broadcast: Call this method to notify all subscriptions in the
            group. NOTE: If call is in an asynchronous context then await
            the result of call.
        unsubscribe: Call this method to stop all subscriptions in the
            group.
