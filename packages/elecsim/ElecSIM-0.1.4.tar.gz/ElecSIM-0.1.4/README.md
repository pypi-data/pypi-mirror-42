## ElecSIM 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderkell/elecsim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderkell/elecsim)

This prepository contains the functionality for the ElecSIM package. ElecSIM is an agent-based model of an electricity market. ElecSIM can be generalised to any country, with starting parameters set in a scenario file.

Through the manipulation of a scenario file, one can build a custom environment of electricity producers with their respective power plants, and an electricity market which matches demand with supply.

ElecSIM allows users to explore the effect of different policy options and starting conditions on electricity markets.
