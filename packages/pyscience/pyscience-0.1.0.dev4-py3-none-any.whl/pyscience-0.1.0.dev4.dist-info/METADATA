﻿Pyscience
=========

Pyscience is a easy python library and command-line application to work with
mathematical operations and other science related programming. Also you can manage
CSV data with the datam module. See API documentation for more information.

Pyscience requires Python 3.7+ to work.

Installation
------------
You can install Pyscience using pip (as root)::

    pip3 install pyscience

If you want to install the latest development version, you need to add the `--pre’
flag::

    pip3 install --pre pyscience

Pre-releases have the latest features and bug fixes.

At this time, only development versions are available.

Basic usage
-----------
Once installed, you can run pyscience as a normal program::

    pyscience

This should start pyscience’s interactive interpreter. You can operate with
variables::

    > 2x+3x
    5x
    > 2x*7y
    14xy

Or get Chemical Elements information with the ‘CE’ function::

    # Returns chemical element with symbol ‘H’
    > CE(‘H’) 
    ...
    # Returns chemical element with atomic number 2
    > CE(2)
    ...
    >


Todo
----
Pyscience is in current development. Future features:

* Math functions
* Update chemicals elements information
* Add multilingual support to program's messages
* Polynomial division
* Physics functions
* Complete parser module. This feature is not enabled yet.
* Documentation
