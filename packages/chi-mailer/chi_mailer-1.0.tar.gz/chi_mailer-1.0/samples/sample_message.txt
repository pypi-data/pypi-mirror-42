Dear ${PERSON_NAME},

Am written to inform you that..
The ${Person_Name} is a python templating method,
to enable us call the username from all the emails in contact.txt,
one after the other by there username. You can imagine typing the username
one after another for all the email recipient how tedious it would be.
Hence the reason to use the method.

Have a great day!

Yours Truly,
Lorem sample.
