        The tools is especially useful in combination with auto lockscreens.
        The user can be notified (by a dimming action on the screen or by showing a
        text message on the display) about the fact that the computer is being locked,
        and can perform an action such as moving the mouse to dismiss the action.

           ./until_nonidle.py sleep 10
        
        The ``sleep 10`` command terminates if the user comes back from idling.
