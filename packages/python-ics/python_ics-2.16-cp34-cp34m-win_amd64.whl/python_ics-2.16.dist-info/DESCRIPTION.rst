Python C Code module for interfacing to the icsneo40 dynamic library. Code tries 
to respect PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Function naming convention does 
not follow the tradition c style icsneo40 naming convention as the python_ics module 
name acts as the namespace (icsneo portion of the function) and function names 
are suppose to be lowercase with underscores instead of mixedCase like icsneo API.
