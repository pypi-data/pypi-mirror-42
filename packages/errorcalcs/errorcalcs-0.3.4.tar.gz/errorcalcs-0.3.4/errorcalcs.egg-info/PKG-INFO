        "ErroRCalcS" is a GUI-tool to calculate uncertainties by using the uncertainties and the PyQt5 packages.
        
        ## update 0.3.1
        In version 0.3.1 there are some new features:
        
        * you can chose now where to save the formula file via the 'save here'-button
        * you can open the file directly by clicking 'open'
        * the Program checks the internetconnection in order to chose from where to open the usage.md
        * completely new structure: some functions have been moved from GUI. py and calc. py to a new script (add. py) to make the program code easier to read.
        
        Furthermore some bugs were fixed.
        
        ## Usage / funktion
        The aplication starts with a window with different input fields (see picture below):
        
        - variable (name of variable, e.g. d)
        - value (Value of variable e.g. 7.1)
        - error (correspondending error on the variable, e.g. 0.8 or 0,8)
        - formula (desired formula, using the variables and further values and arithmetic characters
        
        ![Screenshot of ErroRCalcS' main window](./pictures/screenshots/screenshot_ubuntu_0.3.0.png)
        
        By clicking on the 'add-variable' button, the entries are written to files in a folder named '.\_\_log\_\_'. By clicking on the 'calculation' button, the formula entry is also written to a file in the '.\_\_log\_\_' and 'calc.py' starts running, and writes the calculation and the result in files into the '.\_\_log\_\_'.
        Variables can be overwritten.
        
        By selecting a format behind 'Safe used Formula for' the used formula for error propagation is written into a file named 'saved_formula.txt' in the current directory. By clicking the 'save-here'-button you can chose, where to save the used formula. Clicking the 'open'-button leads directly to the file where the formula was saved in.
        
        If LaTex is selected, the formula is also written to the .txt file. You can copy this into a .tex document. If you import there the 'amsmath' module (\usepackage{amsmath}), you can use this formula without editing.

        ## Requirements
        - Python >= 3.4
        - uncertainties
        - PyQt5
        
        ## Installation
        errorcalcs can be installed by `pip3 install errorcalcs` (Linux) or simply `pip install errorcalcs` (Windows). You can run the GUI with following code:
        
        	from errorcalcs.errorcalcs import run\_e\_c
        	run\_e\_c()
