        ## Installation
        
        Clone the repository to your computer
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/hlgirard/Simplabel.git
        ```
        
        and install with pip 
        
        ```
        cd Simplabel
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Command line tool
        
        Pass the categories and image directory on the command line to start the GUI
        
        ```
        simplabel --categories dog cat bird --directory path/to/image/directory
        ```
        
        ### Python object
        
        ```python
        import simplabel
        import tkinter as tk
        
        root = tk.Tk() 
        directory = "data/raw"
        categories = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
        MyApp = simplabel.ImageClassifier(root, directory, categories)
        tk.mainloop()
        ```
        
        ### Saved labels
        
        The app saves a labelled.pkl file that contains a pickeled dictionary {image_name.jpg: label}. To import the dictionary, use the following sample code:
        
        ```python
        import pickle
        
        with open("labelled.pkl","rb") as f:
            label_dict = pickle.load(f)
        ```
        
        ### Graphical interface
        
        Use the on-screen buttons to select a label for the current image and advance to the next one. Number keys correspond to labels and can be used instead.
