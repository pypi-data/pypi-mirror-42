Description: # Simplabel
        
        Graphical tool to manually label images in distinct categories to build training datasets.
        Simply pass a list of categories, a directory containing images and start labelling.
        Supports keyboard bindings to label even faster!

        ## Installation
        
        ### Install with pip
        
        Simplabel is on PyPI so it can be installed with pip
        
        ```
        pip install simplabel
        ```
        
        ### Install from source
        
        Clone the repository to your computer
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/hlgirard/Simplabel.git
        ```
        
        and install with pip 
        
        ```
        cd Simplabel
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Command line tools
        
        Pass the categories and image directory on the command line to start labelling. Use the on-screen buttons to select a label for the current image and advance to the next one. Number keys correspond to labels and can be used instead.
        
        ```
        simplabel --categories dog cat bird --directory path/to/image/directory
        ```
        
        Once you are done labelling, use the flow_to_directory tool to copy images to distinct directories by label
        
        ```
        flow_to_directory --rawDirectory data/raw --outDirectory data/labeled
        ```
        
        ### Python object
        
        ```python
        from simplabel import ImageClassifier
        import tkinter as tk
        
        root = tk.Tk() 
        directory = "data/raw"
        categories = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
        MyApp = ImageClassifier(root, directory, categories)
        tk.mainloop()
        ```
        
        ### Saved labels
        
        The app saves a labeled.pkl file that contains a pickeled dictionary {image_name: label}. To import the dictionary, use the following sample code:
        
        ```python
        import pickle
        
        with open("labeled.pkl","rb") as f:
            label_dict = pickle.load(f)
        ```
        
        ### Move labeled images to discrete directories
        
        This utility copies labeled images from the raw directory to discrete folders by label in the labelled directory using the dictionary created by simplabel.
        
        ```python
        from simplabel import utils
        
        utils.flow_to_dict(rawDirectory, labelledDirectory)
        ```
