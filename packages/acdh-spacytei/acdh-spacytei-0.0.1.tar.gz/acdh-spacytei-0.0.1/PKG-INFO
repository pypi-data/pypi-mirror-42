Description: Readme
        ======
        
        The APIS_ project intents to semantically annotate the Austrian Bibliography Lexicon (Ã–BL_). To achieve this goal
        we develop(ed) this web-app. It is based on a 5 entities (person, place, institution, event, work) data model.
        All 5 entities are connected to each other. Entities, as well as relations between them, can be typed with vocabularies
        similar to the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS_).
        
        APIS comes with a built in system of autocompletes that allows researchers to import meta-data of entities with just a
        single click. Out of the box APIS supports Stanbol_ as a backend for the autocompletes, but the system is rather easy to
        adapt to any Restfull API. APIS also supports the parsing of RDFs_ describing entities into an entity. The parsing is
        configured in a settings file.
        
        APIS comes also with a built in highlighter. The highlighter is configured via the built in admin backend and allows
        to annotate texts with entities and/or relations between entities.
        
        For a demo of the application please refer to apisdev_.
