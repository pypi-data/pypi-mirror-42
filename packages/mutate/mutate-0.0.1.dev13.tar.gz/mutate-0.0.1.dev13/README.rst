Scribe
======

Python Library for generating docs conforming to common data model .

scribe is a python library to process data collected and conform it to
common data model to facilitate data indexing into elasticsearch.
Currently scribe only supports data collected through stockpile but
it's very easy to integrate other data sources.

It is suggested to use a venv to install and run scribe.

::

    python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
    source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
    pip install mutate
    # For testing purposes you can do clone the repo first
    # and then install as a local project
    git clone https://github.com/redhat-performance/scribe.git
    pip install -e scribe/

Note: we're creating a python3 venv here as scribe is written in python3
and is currently incompatible with python2

Using scribe as a python library
--------------------------------

Scribe is provided by the python library mutate, which helps
to transcribe an input document to a series of documents that conform
to CDM. It can be done as follows.

::

    from mutate.transcribe import scribe
    for scribe_object in scribe('/tmp/stockpile.json','stockpile'):
        print(scribe_object)

Contributing(create patchsets)
------------------------------

Please visit http://gerrithub.io/ and Sign In with your github account.
Make sure to import your ssh keys.

Now, clone the github repository

::

        $ git clone https://github.com/redhat-performance/scribe.git

Make sure, you've git-review installed, following should work.

::

        $ sudo pip install git-review

To set up your cloned repository to work with Gerrit

::

        $ git review -s

It's suggested to create a branch to do your work, name it something
related to the change you'd like to introduce.

::

        $ git branch my_special_enhancement
        $ git checkout !$

Make your changes and then commit them using the instructions below.

::

        $ git add /path/to/files/changed
        $ git commit -m "your commit title"

Use a descriptive commit title followed by an empty space. You should
type a small justification of what you are changing and why.

Now you're ready to submit your changes for review:

::

        $ git review

If you want to make another patchset from the same commit you can use
the amend feature after further modification and saving. Make sure to be
on same branch, and if don't have the branch please follow next set of
instructions

::

        $ git add /path/to/files/changed
        $ git commit --amend
        $ git review

If you want to submit a new patchset from a different location (perhaps
on a different machine or computer for example) you can clone the repo
again (if it doesn't already exist) and then use git review against your
unique Change-ID:

::

        $ git review -d Change-Id

Change-Id is the change id number as seen in Gerrit and will be
generated after your first successful submission. So, in case of
https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/redhat-performance/scribe/+/425014/

You can either do git review -d 425014 as it's the number or you can do
git review -d If0b7b4f30615e46f009759b32a3fc533e811ebdc where
If0b7b4f30615e46f009759b32a3fc533e811ebdc is the change-id present

Make the changes on the branch that was setup by using the git review -d
(the name of the branch is along the lines of
review/username/branch\_name/patchsetnumber).

Add the files to git and commit your changes using,

::

        $ git commit --amend

You can edit your commit message as well in the prompt shown upon
executing above command.

Finally, push the patch for review using,

::

        $ git review

Adding Depends-On to commit message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of times, especially when adding a new module.. Changes made to
scribe, will not ensure the CI to work propery until the respective
changes to stockpile are merged. In this case, to ensure CI doesn't work
with master branch of stockpile but rather the patchset you submitted to
stockpile, You can use the depends-on functionality.

To add Depends-On functionality, please copy the Change-Id of the
patchset you submitted to stockpile, and add it to the commit message at
the end like this.

Note: Please add it after Change-Id in commit message.

The commit message should look like:

::

    Your commit message

    Change-Id: I9bc121f076b8625da88705c9d96bd00117f94c22

    Depends-On: {Change-Id of the review submitted to stockpile}

Say for example, you're working on adding a module to process satellite
data, the CI won't be able to test it because stockpile doesn't have a
satellite collection yet. However, because you've a commit thats still
yet to be merged like
https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/redhat-performance/stockpile/+/425015/

You can still ensure and verify stockpile-scribe workflow by adding
Depends-On to your commit message in scribe, so commit message will look
like:

::

    Adding satellite Module to work with stockpile.

    Change-Id: some_random_change_id_generated_after_git_review

    Depends-On: I66329511b38a558ce61efb7edb4c3be18625b252

Note that the change ID in Depends-On is the same one in
https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/redhat-performance/stockpile/+/425015/

For another example look at:
https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/redhat-performance/scribe/+/425969/

Contributing(making changes)
----------------------------

Scribe package is basically made of two modules:

1. scribes
2. scribe\_modules

These 2 modules serve different purpose, scribes are for reading the
input data and pre-processing them into a structure that can be used to
create scribe\_modules

The pre-processed dictionary structure can look like this:

.. code:: json

      {
      "scribe_module_1": [
          {
              "host": "localhost",
              "value": "sample_value_1"
          },
          {
              "host": "host1",
              "value": "sample_value_2"
          },
          {
              "host": "host2",
              "value": "sample_value_3"
          }
      ],
      "scribe_module_2": [
          {
              "host": "host2",
              "value": {
                  "field1": "sample_filed1_value_3",
                  "field2": "sample_field2_value_3"
              }
          },
          {
              "host": "host1",
              "value": [
                  {
                      "field1": "sample_filed1_value_1",
                      "field2": "sample_field2_value_1"
                  },
                  {
                      "field1": "sample_filed1_value_2",
                      "field2": "sample_field2_value_2"
                  }
              ]
          }
      ]
      }

Basically the dictionary needs to have first level keys that you've
written 'scribe\_modules', match the name of the file in
scribe\_modules/ . The children of each of the module in dictionary
should have the 2 keys - 'host' and 'value'. the value for the key
'value' can be either a dictionary or a list of dictionary

Please note that the value for the key 'value' will be the one passed to
the scribe\_modules while creating the object.

So let's take the simple example of scribe\_module\_2 for host2, just
one object would be created and the value passed would be

.. code:: json

      {
      "field1": "sample_filed1_value_3",
      "field2": "sample_field2_value_3"
      }

And like wise for host1, there will be 2 objects created.

for object 1, following value would be passed:

.. code:: json

      {
      "field1": "sample_filed1_value_1",
      "field2": "sample_field2_value_1"
      }

for object 2, following value would be passed:

.. code:: json

      {
      "field1": "sample_filed1_value_2",
      "field2": "sample_field2_value_2"
      }

While for scribe\_module\_1 for host1, the value that will be passed
would be: "sample\_value\_2"

Adding new scribes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Steps to extend scribe to work with a new input-type 'example1' would
involve:

1. Creating 'example1.py' in the 'mutate/scribes/' directory. The
   sample code would look like:

.. code:: python


    from . import ScribeBaseClass


    class Example1(ScribeBaseClass):

        def example1_build_initial_dict(self):
            output_dict = {}
            Example1_data = load_file(self._path)
            # .... some sort of data manipulation
            # .... to build the output_dict
            return output_dict

        def __init__(self, path=None, source_type=None):
            ScribeBaseClass.__init__(self, source_type=source_type, path=path)
            self._dict = self.example1_build_initial_dict()

        def emit_scribe_dict(self):
            return self._dict

Note the following:

a) from . import ScribeBaseClass needs to be present as we are
   inheriting from the ScribeBaseClass

b) class Example1(ScribeBaseClass) is where inheritance occurs, ensure
   that '(ScribeBaseClass)' is present when you write the class
   definition

c) The first letter in classname must be uppercase that's how factory
   method is defined.

d) The \_\_init\_\_ function first calls the parent's \_\_init\_\_
   function and passes the default arguments which are path and
   source\_type, however more can be added. and they won't be needed to
   passed on to parent class's \_\_init\_\_ function.

e) emit\_scribe\_dict is an abstractmethod and thus it needs to be
   defined in any other class that is written. However the method itself
   can be changed but it should return the dictionary object as
   described above.

2. Add the module to choices list in scribe.py at L14, currently it
   looks like choices=['stockpile'], because at the time of creating
   this documentation only stockpile data could be transcribed using
   scribe.

Adding new scribe\_modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Steps to extend scribe\_modules to work with a new module
'scribe\_module\_1' would involve:

1. Adding a new class 'scribe\_module\_1.py' to directory
   'mutate/scribe\_modules'. It'd probably look something like this:
   \`\`\`python

from . import ScribeModuleBaseClass

class Scribe\_module\_1(ScribeModuleBaseClass):

::

      def __init__(self, input_dict=None, module_name=None, host_name=None,
                   input_type=None, scribe_uuid=None):
          ScribeModuleBaseClass.__init__(self, module_name=module_name,
                                         input_dict=input_dict,
                                         host_name=host_name,
                                         input_type=input_type,
                                         scribe_uuid=scribe_uuid)
          if input_dict:
              new_dict = {}
              # ... this is where transformation occurs
              # ... can call other member functions of class
              # ... can set the entities of the class object like
              self.entity_1 = input_dict

      # This isn't needed here, as it's how the __iter__ function is defined
      # in the parent class and it's not an abstractmethod, so only if you'd
      # like to change how __iter__ method should work for your class, you
      # should add the following next lines.
      # Not recommended, unless you know what you're doing
      def __iter__(self):
            # ... your definition of how to make it iterable

\`\`\`

Note the following important things:

a) from . import ScribeModuleBaseClass needs to be present as we are
   inheriting from the ScribeModuleBaseClass

b) class Example1(ScribeModuleBaseClass) is where inheritance occurs,
   ensure that '(ScribeModuleBaseClass)' is present when you write the
   class.

c) The first letter in classname must be uppercase that's how factory
   method is defined.

d) The \_\_init\_\_ function first calls the parent's \_\_init\_\_
   function and passes the default arguments which are module\_name,
   input\_dict, host\_name, input\_type and scribe\_uuid. Please note
   that no more arguments can be passed.

e) setting the new entities should be done inside the \_\_init\_\_
   function only, but the user has flexibility of calling another method
   from either same class or from lib/util.py to do transformation.

2. Add schema for the new class 'example1.yml' to the directory
   'mutate/schema'. Scribe currently uses cerberus to validate the
   iterable produced by the scribe\_modules subclass. Please look at
   http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/validation-rules.html for
   more information on how to write the schema for your class's output.

Note: The name of the yml file should match that of the scribe\_modules
class that you create it for. Thus, for 'example1' class the file should
be named 'example1.yml'

Data Model and ES templates
---------------------------

Directory 'mutate/schema' will essentially contain the data model.
Work needs to be done so that these yml files can be used to create
templates for elasticsearch. It's on the line of the ViaQ's
elasticsearch templates work.

Please refer https://github.com/ViaQ/elasticsearch-templates for more
info on how templates can be created.

Do note that, currently ViaQ/elasticsearch-templates doesn't support
creating templates from the schema files present in 'mutate/schema'
