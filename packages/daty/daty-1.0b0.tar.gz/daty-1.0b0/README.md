[![Daty overview](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Daty/raw/master/screenshots/overview.png)](screenshots/overview.png)

*Daty* is a free cross-platform advanced Wikidata editor adhering to [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/), intended to enable better editing workflow and faster deployment of requested user features.
Use *Daty* to search, select, read, batch edit items, script actions, share, visualize proposed changes and bots.

*Daty* is written in Python 3 and it uses [GTK+ 3.0](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/) python bindings for interface organization and drawing.

It has a progressive layout thanks to [libhandy](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy) and uses [pywikibot](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/profile/87/) as a backend. 

## Current status

The development of the current version (1.0Î±) has been made possible thanks to a sponsorship provided by [Wikimedia CH](https://wikimedia.ch). 

Endorse the project on [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/wiki/User:Ogoorcs/Daty/Endorsement) to help the development get funds.

An overview of what you will find in the stable 1.0 version is available at project presentation [page](https://prevete.ml/articles/daty.html).
