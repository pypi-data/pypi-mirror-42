Import KeePass secrets in Hashicorp Vault
=========================================

`vault-keepass-import
<https://lab.enough.community/singuliere/vault-keepass-import>`_ is a
CLI to import `KeePass <https://keepass.info/>`_ secrets (using
`pykeepass <https://github.com/pschmitt/pykeepass>`_) in `Hashicorp
Vault <https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/install>`_
(using `hvac <https://hvac.readthedocs.io>`_).

Bugs and feature requests can be found `in the issue tracker
<https://lab.enough.community/singuliere/vault-keepass-import/issues>`_

The `Title` of the entry is used as the last component of the secret
path. For instance if importing an entry with `Title` `mysecret` in
the `mygroup` group, the path `secret/keepass/mygroup/mysecret` will
be used.

There may be multiple entries with the same title in a group. The path
is made unique by appending the `UUID` of the entry to the title. For
instance two entries with the same `title1` in the group `group1` will
be imported as `group1/title1 (TJxu0nxlyEuaKYNYpi0NPQ==)` and
`group1/title1 (kFl/iRsoVUWDUdmmCDXwJg==)`. The `UUID` is not appended
if the title is unique.

All trailing whitespaces are trimmed, in each path component
(i.e. **s|\s+/|/|g** and **s|\s+$||**). This is required because of a `bug in
Vault 1.0.2 <https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/6213>`_ that
makes it impossible to list a path that ends with a whitespace via the
CLI (the web UI works fine).

* `User name` from the `Entry` tab is imported as is under the key `username`
* `Password` from the `Entry` tab is imported as is under the key `password`
* `URL` from the `Entry` tab is imported as is under the key `url`
* `Notes` from the `Entry` tab is imported as is under the key `notes`
* `Expires` from the `Entry` tab is imported under the key
  `expiry_time`. It is only imported if set and converted to `epoch
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`_.
* `Tags` from the `Properties` tab is imported as is under the key `tags`
* `UUID` from the `Properties` tab is imported as is under the key `uuid`
* `String fields` from the `Advanced` tab are imported as is with a key
  matching their `Name` and a value set to their `Value`
* `File attachments` from the `Advanced` tab are imported with a key
  set to **id/filename** (for instance if there only is one
  **foo.txt** attachment, it will have the key **0/foo.txt**) and the
  value is base64 encoded. For instance, the actual value can be
  retrieved from the command line with:

  .. code::

     $ vault kv get -field 8/attached.txt secret/mysecret | base64 --decode
* `mtime`, `ctime`, `atime` are always imported and converted to `epoch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`_

Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

   $ pip3 install vault-keepass-import
   $ export VAULT_ADDR=https://myvault.com:8200
   $ export VAULT_TOKEN=mytoken
   $ vault-keepass-import database.kdbx
   KeePass password:
   $ vault kv list secret/keepass
   Keys
   ----
   Group1/
   Group2/
   secret1
   secret2
   $ vault kv get secret/keepass/secret1

Testing the import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Download and `install Hashicorp Vault <https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/install>`_
* Run vault in development mode (the storage is reset when it restarts)

  .. code::

     $ vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=mytoken

* Assuming the password to the KeePass database is `kdbxpassword`, run an import with:

  .. code::

     $ vault-keepass-import --token mytoken \
			    --password kdbxpassword \
			    database.kdbx

Command help
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. argparse::
   :module: vault_keepass_import.main
   :func: parser
   :prog: vault-keepass-import
