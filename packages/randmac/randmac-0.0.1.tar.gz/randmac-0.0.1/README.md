==========

a utility that generates 12-digit mac addresses; either vendor portion or full mac. 

the optional `-f` argument will return a random 12-digit MAC address that can be identified by the locally administrated address (LAA) format. This means you will always see `x2`, `x6`, `xA`, or `xE` at the beginning of a MAC address generated by randmac.

# installation

`pip install randmac`

# requirements

 - MM:MM:MM:SS:SS:SS
 - MM-MM-MM-SS-SS-SS
 - MM.MM.MM.SS.SS.SS

where `M` stands for the manufacturer or vendor, and `S` stands for the NIC specific portion. 

# usage
