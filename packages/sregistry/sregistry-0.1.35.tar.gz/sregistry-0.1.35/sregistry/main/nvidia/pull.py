def pull(self, images, file_name=None, save=True, force=False, **kwargs):
    '''pull an image from a docker hub. This is a (less than ideal) workaround
       that actually does the following:

       - creates a sandbox folder
       - adds docker layers, metadata folder, and custom metadata to it
       - converts to a squashfs image with build

    the docker manifests are stored with registry metadata.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
    images: refers to the uri given by the user to pull in the format
    <collection>/<namespace>. You should have an API that is able to 
    retrieve a container based on parsing this uri.
    file_name: the user's requested name for the file. It can 
               optionally be None if the user wants a default.
    save: if True, you should save the container to the database
          using self.add()
    
    Returns
    =======
    finished: a single container path, or list of paths
