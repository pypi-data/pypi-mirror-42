       ==========
       path: should correspond to an absolute image path (or derive it)
       name: should be the complete uri that the user has requested to push.
       tag: should correspond with an image tag. This is provided to mirror Docker

       if the image is less than 150MB, the standard file_upload is used. If
       larger, the image is uploaded in chunks with a progress bar.
