Description: 
        ===================
        Introduction
        ===================
        tkgtools is a library which is used as a base for 3GPP security architecture.
        
        tkg is stands for 3GPP Key Generator.
        
        Only f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f1* and f5* are supported in this library.
        
        tkgtools is written on python 3.6.5, python 2 is not supported.
