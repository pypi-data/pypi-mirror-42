Description: # Blackout
        
        ## Overview
        Blackout is a small micro-module which makes it easier to completely
        forget packages. This is particularly useful when working with packages
        made up of multiple sub-modules.
        
        And example might be:
        
            /site-packages/foo/__init__.py
            /site-packages/foo/bar.py
        
        If bar.py has a function called foo() within it, and we change that
        function then it is not enough to reload foo, we must specifically
        reload foo as well as foo.bar. 
        
        When working with packages with any modules this can be time consuming
        and problematic - particularly when developing within a host which is
        persistent.
        
        Blackout helps, because we can unload the package in its entirety in 
        a single line using:
        
            ```blackout.drop('foo')```
        
        This will remove any hold to foo as well as any submodules of foo. In this 
        case we can simply call ```import foo``` again, knowing that everything
        within that package is being loaded fresh.
        
        ## Compatability
        
        This has been tested under Python 2.7.13 and Python 3.6.6 under both Windows and Ubuntu.
