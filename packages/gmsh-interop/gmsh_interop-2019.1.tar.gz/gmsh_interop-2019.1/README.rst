Interoperability between Python and Gmsh
========================================

This package allows Python to interoperate with the `gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`_
mesh generator.

This package contains:

* ``gmsh_interop.reader`` to read gmsh's ``.msh`` file format.
* ``gmsh_interop.runner`` to run gmsh under program control and process its output.

Its contents was extracted from `meshpy <https:///github.com/inducer/meshpy>`_
to escape its obnoxious licensing.

* `Python package index <https://pypi.org/project/gmsh_interop/>`_
