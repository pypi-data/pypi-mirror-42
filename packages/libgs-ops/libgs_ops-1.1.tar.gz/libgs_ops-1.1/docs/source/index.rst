Welcome to the documentation for libgs ops
==========================================

libgs-ops is a library for planning satellite passes and then creating schedules that can be executed on a libgs-based ground station.

It consists of 2 main modules; the propagator module is a generic pyephem based library for analysing orbits and planning passes, 
whereas scheduling is aimed at making libgs-compatible communication schedules.


Installation
-------------

libgs-ops is fairly light on requirements and should be possible to run on any rasonable python installation.

.. note::

   python3 support is planned and should not pose any great difficulty to implement. It has however not been prioritised up to
   this point as no users have expressed strong need for it.

.. warning::

   If you are reading this on readthedocs, the documentation is most likely broken.
   So until I succeed in getting it to play nice with RTD (i.e. until further notice), it will be hosted
   on github pages and you can access it at the following address:
