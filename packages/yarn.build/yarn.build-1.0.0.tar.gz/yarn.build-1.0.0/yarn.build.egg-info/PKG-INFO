Description: Introduction
        ============
        This package builds JavaScript projects with `yarn`_.
        It contains a `zest.releaser`_ entry point and a stand-alone command line tool.
        
        Goal
        ====
        You want to release a package that has a ``packages.json`` on it and a ``release`` script defined on it.
        
        Usually one does not want to keep the generated files on VCS,
        but you want them when releasing with `zest.releaser`_.
        
        Credits
        =======
        This package is a direct inspiration from `zest.pocompile`_ from Maurits van Rees.
        
        Thanks!
