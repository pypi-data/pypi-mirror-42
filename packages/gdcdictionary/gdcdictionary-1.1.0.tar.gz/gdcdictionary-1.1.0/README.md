GDC Data Dictionary
===================
JSON schemas to define the entities (nodes) and relationships (edges)
in the GDC data model. As versions of this repository are made, they will
be the authoritative source of this information.

The current approach is to make a set of JSON schemas that match the underlying
graph model. Once that is complete, a version of the dictionary will be made.
Then development of the dictionary for the next version will be begin to fix
known issues and make modifications to support active submission.
