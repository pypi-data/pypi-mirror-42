    'long_description': '==================\nFlask Behind Proxy\n==================\n\n\nProvide a middleware for Flask application, to fix redirection issue when the application runs behind a reverse proxy, like Nginx.\n\nThe redirection issue is that, when your website is HTTPS and a *view* returns a 301/302 reponse, the new URL mistakenly becomes HTTP.\n\nThis resolution requires you to configure Nginx so that it passes a custom header, to inform the scheme (HTTPS) of the original request. To do that, you just need to setup like this in your Nginx virtualhost config:\n\n.. code-block:: nginx\n\n    location / {\n        include         proxy_params;\n        proxy_pass      http://localhost:8000;\n    }\n\nThis is the common setup for Nginx on Debian/Ubuntu. Nginx on other distros may not have *proxy_params* file, you can add configuration like this:\n\n.. code-block:: nginx\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass       http://localhost:8000;\n        proxy_set_header Host              $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n\nCurrently, *Flask Behind Proxy* is only tested with Nginx web server.\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    pip install flask-behind-proxy\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from flask import Flask\n    from flask_behind_proxy import FlaskBehindProxy\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n    proxied = FlaskBehindProxy(app)\n\n\nOther implementation\n--------------------\n\nOther implementation is `Flask Reverse Proxy <https://github.com/wilbertom/flask-reverse-proxy>`_. It is based on a header name that is not "standard" (in my terms, it is the name chosen by Debian/Ubuntu maintainer). I chose to make a new software myself, instead of contributing to *Flask Reverse Proxy*, because **wilbertom** seems not to be very reactive, and I want to have a clean code, without Python 2 backward compatibility, and newer tool (like *pyproject.toml* file).\n',
