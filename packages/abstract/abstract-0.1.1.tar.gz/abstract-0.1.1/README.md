# Abstract
Abstract is a Python library for creating and drawing graphs 
and taking advantage of graph properties.

## Graph
In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that 
is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph 
concepts from mathematics; specifically, the field of graph theory.

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) 
set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of 
unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or 
a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known 
as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. 
The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external 
entities represented by integer indices or references.

## Future Features

* Create a graph from:
  * list of dictionaries
  * dataframe
* Create a new graph by filtering a graph
