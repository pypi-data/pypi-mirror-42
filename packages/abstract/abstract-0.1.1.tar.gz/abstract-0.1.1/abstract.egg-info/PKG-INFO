Description: # Abstract
        Abstract is a Python library for creating and drawing graphs 
        and taking advantage of graph properties.
        
        ## Graph
        In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that 
        is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph 
        concepts from mathematics; specifically, the field of graph theory. 
        [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))
        
        A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) 
        set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of 
        unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or 
        a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known 
        as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
        directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. 
        The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external 
        entities represented by integer indices or references.

        ## Future Features
        
        * Create a graph from:
          * list of dictionaries
          * dataframe
        * Create a new graph by filtering a graph
