Description: # SCOPE - Supervised Cancer Origin Prediction using Expression  
        A python package that takes the whole transcriptome of a sample as input, and outputs a set of probabilities across 66 different categories (40 tumor types and 26 healthy tissues) that sum to 1.  
        
        You can also train additional models and include them in the ensemble that SCOPE uses (Instructions forthcoming).

        ## Installation   
        ### Automated Install   
        SCOPE can be installed using the command `pip install cancerscope`    
        
        ## Setup and Usage  
        To get started with SCOPE, launch a python instance and run:  
        `>>> import cancerscope`  
        `>>> cancerscope.test_setup()`  
        
        
        ## Folder descriptors  
        All scripts required to run SCOPE are [included](cancerscope/bin).
        
        Prior to running [the predictor](cancerscope/bin/lasagne_SCOPE_testsample.py), you will need to ensure you have the correct Python envirnoment set up. SCOPE requires Python 2.7.14.
        - You can set up a custom Conda environment with the required packages from [here](cancerscope/cancerscope/bin/conda_env.yml).
