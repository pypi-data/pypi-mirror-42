# Purpose

This project is intended to bring together lots of different hardware
projects into a single unified API to ease hardware test development.
Using this project, it should be easier to write a Python-driven hardware
test using the old Python favorites.  In many ways, this is somewhat
equivalent to LabView in functionality, but with all of the advantages
of Python.  Enjoy!

For more information, be sure to check out the 
[documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/subdue/)!

# Installation Requirements

You will need to have a working installation of 
[Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) environment to run
`subdue`.  Installation of some or all software may require
administrative access.

It is recommended that `python` be added to the `PATH` and that `*.py`
extensions are associated with `python`.

# Installation Instructions

To install, simply `pip install subdue`.  Note that there are several
external dependencies.  See the [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/subdue/) 
for details.

## Examples

Several examples are provided for your convenience within the 
`/examples` directory.  Simply run the example in your python environment.
Note that the examples will require attached hardware, hardware drivers,
and may require other packages (such as `requests`).

# Project Maturity

The generic API of this project is expected to change somewhat, but is beginning
to firm up.  I expect that more instruments will be added as I begin to work with
more hardware.  The instruments currently populated have been sufficient for
most of my test needs at this time.

# Contributions

Please use the [issues](https://github.com/slightlynybbled/subdue/issues)
to request support for new hardware.  As I likely do not have a set of 
hardware for development, I may not be able to add functionality to the
library with confidence.  Pull requests are welcome!
