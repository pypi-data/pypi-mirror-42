Installation and Quick Start Guides
===================================

VMTP can be installed on any server that has access to the OpenStack API.
There are 3 ways to install and run the VMTP tool:

- Docker container
- PyPI package 
- Git

The Git installation is required for VMTP developers and can be used for users who want to have access to the VMTP source code.
Otherwise, most users should select the Docker container installation (if already using Docker containers) or the more "pythonic" method with PyPI packages/pip.
