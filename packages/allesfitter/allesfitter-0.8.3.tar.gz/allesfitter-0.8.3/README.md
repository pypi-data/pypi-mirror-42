[German-ish for *everything-fitter*]

*allesfitter* (G端nther & Daylan, in prep.) is a public and user-friendly astronomy software package for modeling photometric and RV data. It can accommodate multiple exoplanets, multi-star systems, star spots, stellar flares, and various noise models. A graphical user interface allows to define all input. Then, *allesfitter* automatically runs a nested sampling or MCMC fit, and produces ascii tables, latex tables, and plots. For all this, *allesfitter* constructs an inference framework that unites the versatile packages *ellc* (light curve and RV models; Maxted 2016), *aflare* (flare model; Davenport et al. 2014), *dynesty* (static and dynamic nested sampling; https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty), *emcee* (Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling; Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) and *celerite* (Gaussian Process models; Foreman-Mackey et al. 2017).
