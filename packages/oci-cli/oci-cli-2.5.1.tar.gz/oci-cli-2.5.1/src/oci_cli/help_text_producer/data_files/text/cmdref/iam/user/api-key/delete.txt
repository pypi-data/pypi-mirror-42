delete
******


Description
===========

Deletes the specified API signing key for the specified user.

Every user has permission to use this operation to delete a key for
*their own user ID*. An administrator in your organization does not
need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare,
administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this
operation to delete a key for any user, including themselves.
