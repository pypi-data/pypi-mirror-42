.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Connects this local peering gateway (LPG) to another one in the same region.
.sp
This operation must be called by the VCN administrator who is designated as the \fIrequestor\fP in the peering relationship. The \fIacceptor\fP must implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that gives the requestor permission to connect to LPGs in the acceptor\(aqs compartment. Without that permission, this operation will fail. For more information, see \fI\%VCN Peering\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNpeering.htm\fP>\&.
