.SS auth\-token
.SS Description
.sp
An \fIAuthToken\fP is an Oracle\-generated token string that you can use to authenticate with third\-party APIs that do not support Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\(aqs signature\-based authentication. For example, use an \fIAuthToken\fP to authenticate with a Swift client with the Object Storage Service.
.sp
The auth token is associated with the user\(aqs Console login. Auth tokens never expire. A user can have up to two auth tokens at a time.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The token is always an Oracle\-generated string; you can\(aqt change it to a string of your choice.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Managing User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm\fP>\&.

Creates a new auth token for the specified user. For information about what auth tokens are for, see \fI\%Managing User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a \fIdescription\fP for the auth token (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateAuthToken\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/AuthToken/UpdateAuthToken\fP>\&.
.sp
Every user has permission to create an auth token for \fItheir own user ID\fP\&. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to create an auth token for any user, including themselves.

.SS compartment
.SS Description
.sp
A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for organizing and isolating your cloud resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for the purposes of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of IAM Service policies), and isolation (separating the resources for one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment for each major part of your organization. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP> and also \fI\%Setting Up Your Tenancy\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/settinguptenancy.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment ID in the "Create" request object when initially creating the resource. For example, to launch an instance into a particular compartment, specify that compartment\(aqs OCID in the \fILaunchInstance\fP request. You can\(aqt move an existing resource from one compartment to another.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the compartment, which must be unique across all compartments in your tenancy. You can use this name or the OCID when writing policies that apply to the compartment. For more information about policies, see \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the compartment (although it can be an empty string).

This operation does not return a list of all the resources inside the compartment. There is no single API operation that does that. Compartments can contain multiple types of resources (instances, block storage volumes, etc.). To find out what\(aqs in a compartment, you must call the "List" operation for each resource type and specify the compartment\(aqs OCID as a query parameter in the request. For example, call the \fI\%ListInstances\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Instance/ListInstances\fP> operation in the Cloud Compute Service or the \fI\%ListVolumes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Volume/ListVolumes\fP> operation in Cloud Block Storage.

.SS list
.SS Description
.sp
Lists the compartments in a specified compartment. The members of the list returned depends on the values set for several parameters.
.sp
With the exception of the tenancy (root compartment), the ListCompartments operation returns only the first\-level child compartments in the parent compartment specified in \fIcompartmentId\fP\&. The list does not include any subcompartments of the child compartments (grandchildren).
.sp
The parameter \fIaccessLevel\fP specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly or indirectly (the resource can be in a subcompartment).
.sp
The parameter \fIcompartmentIdInSubtree\fP applies only when you perform ListCompartments on the tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned. To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment), set the parameter \fIcompartmentIdInSubtree\fP to true and \fIaccessLevel\fP to ANY.
.sp

.SS dynamic\-group
.SS Description
.sp
A dynamic group defines a matching rule. Every bare metal or virtual machine instance is deployed with an instance certificate. The certificate contains metadata about the instance. This includes the instance OCID and the compartment OCID, along with a few other optional properties. When an API call is made using this instance certificate as the authenticator, the certificate can be matched to one or multiple dynamic groups. The instance can then get access to the API based on the permissions granted in policies written for the dynamic groups.
.sp
This works like regular user/group membership. But in that case, the membership is a static relationship, whereas in a dynamic group, the membership of an instance certificate to a dynamic group is determined during runtime. For more information, see \fI\%Managing Dynamic Groups\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingdynamicgroups.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new tag namespace in the specified compartment.
.sp
You must specify the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment).
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the namespace, which must be unique across all namespaces in your tenancy and cannot be changed. The name can contain any ASCII character except the space (_) or period (.). Names are case insensitive. That means, for example, "myNamespace" and "mynamespace" are not allowed in the same tenancy. Once you created a namespace, you cannot change the name. If you specify a name that\(aqs already in use in the tenancy, a 409 error is returned.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the namespace. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it with \fI\%UpdateTagNamespace\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/tagging/20170101/TagNamespace/UpdateTagNamespace\fP>\&.
.sp
Tag namespaces cannot be deleted, but they can be retired. See \fI\%Retiring Key Definitions and Namespace Definitions\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm#Retiring\fP> for more information.

For more information, see \fI\%Identity Providers and Federation\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.sp
You must specify your tenancy\(aqs OCID as the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances, which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the user, which must be unique across all users in your tenancy and cannot be changed. Allowed characters: No spaces. Only letters, numerals, hyphens, periods, underscores, +, and @. If you specify a name that\(aqs already in use, you\(aqll get a 409 error. This name will be the user\(aqs login to the Console. You might want to pick a name that your company\(aqs own identity system (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) already uses. If you delete a user and then create a new user with the same name, they\(aqll be considered different users because they have different OCIDs.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the user (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateUser\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/User/UpdateUser\fP>\&. You can use the field to provide the user\(aqs full name, a description, a nickname, or other information to generally identify the user.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
.sp
A new user has no permissions until you place the user in one or more groups (see \fI\%AddUserToGroup\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UserGroupMembership/AddUserToGroup\fP>).
