create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new backup in the specified database based on the request
parameters you provide. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to
configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API
for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with
your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your
previously configured unmanaged backups to work.
