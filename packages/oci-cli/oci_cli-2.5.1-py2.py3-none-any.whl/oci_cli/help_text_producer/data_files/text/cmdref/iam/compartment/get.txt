get
***


Description
===========

Gets the specified compartment's information.

This operation does not return a list of all the resources inside the
compartment. There is no single API operation that does that.
Compartments can contain multiple types of resources (instances, block
storage volumes, etc.). To find out what's in a compartment, you must
call the "List" operation for each resource type and specify the
compartment's OCID as a query parameter in the request. For example,
call the ListInstances operation in the Cloud Compute Service or the
ListVolumes operation in Cloud Block Storage.


Usage
