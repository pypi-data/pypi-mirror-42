create
******


Description
===========

**Deprecated. Use `CreateAuthToken <https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclec
loud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/AuthToken/CreateAuthToken>`__
instead.**

Creates a new Swift password for the specified user. For information
about what Swift passwords are for, see Managing User Credentials.

You must specify a *description* for the Swift password (although it
can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can
change it anytime with UpdateSwiftPassword.

Every user has permission to create a Swift password for *their own
user ID*. An administrator in your organization does not need to write
a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who
have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to create a
Swift password for any user, including themselves.
