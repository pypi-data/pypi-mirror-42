.sp
\fBNote:\fP In general, some "List" operations (for example, \fIListInstances\fP) let you optionally filter by Availability Domain if the scope of the resource type is within a single Availability Domain. If you call one of these "List" operations without specifying an Availability Domain, the resources are grouped by Availability Domain, then sorted.

.sp
The sort order to use, either ascending (\fIASC\fP) or descending (\fIDESC\fP). The NAME sort order is case sensitive.
.SS \-\-all

.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
