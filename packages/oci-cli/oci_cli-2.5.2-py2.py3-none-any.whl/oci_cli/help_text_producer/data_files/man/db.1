\- Exadata DB Systems \- Bare Metal and Virtual Machine DB Systems
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
For information about access control and compartments, see Overview of the Identity Service.
For information about availability domains, see [Regions and Availability Domains].
To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity Service API.
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

\fBSubnet Restrictions:\fP \- For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28. \- For Exadata and virtual machine 2\-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.
.sp
These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet. [required]
.SS \-\-shape [text]

.SS \-\-fault\-domains [complex type]
.sp
A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect DB systems in other fault domains.
.sp
If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you. To change the fault domain for a DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB system in the preferred fault domain.
.sp
If the node count is greater than 1, you can specify which fault domains these nodes will be distributed into. The system assigns your nodes automatically to the fault domains you specify so that no fault domain contains more than one node.
.sp
To get a list of fault domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp

.sp
The cluster name for Exadata and 2\-node RAC virtual machine DB systems. The cluster name must begin with an an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (\-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive.

The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the subnet the DB system is associated with.
.sp
\fBSubnet Restrictions:\fP \- For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28. \- For Exadata and virtual machine 2\-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.
.sp
These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet. [required]
.SS \-\-shape [text]

.SS \-\-fault\-domains [complex type]
.sp
A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect DB systems in other fault domains.
.sp
If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you. To change the fault domain for a DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB system in the preferred fault domain.
.sp
If the node count is greater than 1, you can specify which fault domains these nodes will be distributed into. The system assigns your nodes automatically to the fault domains you specify so that no fault domain contains more than one node.
.sp
To get a list of fault domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
