create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new secret key for the specified user. Secret keys are used
for authentication with the Object Storage Service's Amazon S3
compatible API. For information, see Managing User Credentials.

You must specify a *description* for the secret key (although it can
be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change
it anytime with UpdateCustomerSecretKey.

Every user has permission to create a secret key for *their own user
ID*. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a
policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have
permission to the tenancy can use this operation to create a secret
key for any user, including themselves.
