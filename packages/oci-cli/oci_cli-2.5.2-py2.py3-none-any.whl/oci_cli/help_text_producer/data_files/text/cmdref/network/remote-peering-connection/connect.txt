connect
*******


Description
===========

Connects this RPC to another one in a different region.

This operation must be called by the VCN administrator who is
designated as the *requestor* in the peering relationship. The
*acceptor* must implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
policy that gives the requestor permission to connect to RPCs in the
acceptor's compartment. Without that permission, this operation will
fail. For more information, see VCN Peering.
