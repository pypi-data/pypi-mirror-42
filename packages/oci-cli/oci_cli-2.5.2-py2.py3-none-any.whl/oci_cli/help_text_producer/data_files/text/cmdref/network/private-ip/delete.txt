delete
******


Description
===========

Unassigns and deletes the specified private IP. You must specify the
object's OCID. The private IP address is returned to the subnet's pool
of available addresses.

This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are
automatically unassigned and deleted when the VNIC is terminated.

**Important:** If a secondary private IP is the target of a route
rule, unassigning it from the VNIC causes that route rule to blackhole
and the traffic will be dropped.
