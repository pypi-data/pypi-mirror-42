get
***


Description
===========

Returns messages from the specified stream using the specified cursor
as the starting point for consumption. By default, the number of
messages returned is undefined, but the service returns as many as
possible. To get messages, you must first obtain a cursor using the
CreateCursor operation. In the response, retrieve the value of the
'opc-next-cursor' header to pass as a parameter to get the next batch
of messages in the stream.

The top level --endpoint parameter must be supplied for this
operation.
