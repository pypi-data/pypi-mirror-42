create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new auth token for the specified user. For information about
what auth tokens are for, see Managing User Credentials.

You must specify a *description* for the auth token (although it can
be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change
it anytime with UpdateAuthToken.

Every user has permission to create an auth token for *their own user
ID*. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a
policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have
permission to the tenancy can use this operation to create an auth
token for any user, including themselves.
