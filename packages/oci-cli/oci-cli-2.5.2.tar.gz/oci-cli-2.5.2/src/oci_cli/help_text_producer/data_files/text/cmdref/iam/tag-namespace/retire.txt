retire
******


Description
===========

Retire the namespace, all the contained tags and the related rules.
Reactivating a namespace  will not reactivate any tag definition that
is retired when the namespace was retired. They will have to be
individually reactivated *after* the namespace is reactivated. You
can't add a namespace with the same name as a retired namespace in the
same tenant.
