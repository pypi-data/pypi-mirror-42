# Pipeline runner lib and server

Allows a [datapackage-pipelines](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-pipelines) workflow to be spun up and executed.

This is a legacy library used by OpenSpending [os-conductor](https://github.com/openspending/os-conductor/). This could be replaced by better ways to run a pipeline of processors from applications, namely, [Data Flows](https://github.com/datahq/dataflows/).
