        ## Motivation
        We present a new method to detect planetary transits from time-series photometry, the *Transit Least Squares* (TLS) algorithm. While the commonly used Box Least Squares [(BLS, Kovács et al. 2002)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...391..369K) algorithm searches for rectangular signals in stellar light curves, *TLS* searches for transit-like features with stellar limb-darkening and including the effects of planetary ingress and egress. Moreover, *TLS* analyses the entire, unbinned data of the phase-folded light curve. These improvements yield a ~10 % higher detection efficiency (and similar false alarm rates) compared to BLS. The higher detection efficiency of our freely available Python implementation comes at the cost of higher computational load, which we partly compensate by applying an optimized period sampling and transit duration sampling, constrained to the physically plausible range. A typical Kepler K2 light curve, worth of 90 d of observations at a cadence of 30 min, can be searched with *TLS* in 10 seconds real time on a standard laptop computer, just as with BLS.

        ## Installation
        The stable version can be installed via pip: `pip install transitleastsquares`
        
        To get the latest version, use
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/hippke/tls
        cd tls
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Dependencies:
        Python 3,
        [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/),
        [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/),
        [batman-package](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~lkreidberg/batman/),
        [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm),
        optional:
        [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) (for the command line version),
        [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for LD and stellar density priors from Kepler K1, K2, and TESS).
        
        ## Getting started
        Here is a short animation of a real search for planets in Kepler K2 data. For more examples, have a look at the [tutorials](https://github.com/hippke/tls/tree/master/tutorials) and the [documentation](https://transitleastsquares.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
