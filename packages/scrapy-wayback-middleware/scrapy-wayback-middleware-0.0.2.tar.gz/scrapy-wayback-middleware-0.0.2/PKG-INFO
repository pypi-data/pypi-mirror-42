Description: # Scrapy Wayback Middleware
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/City-Bureau/scrapy-wayback-middleware.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/City-Bureau/scrapy-wayback-middleware)
        
        Middleware for submitting all scraped response URLs to the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) for archival.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install scrapy-wayback-middleware
        ```
        
        ## Setup
        
        Add `scrapy_wayback_middleware.WaybackMiddleware` to your project's `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES` settings.
        
        ### Configuration
        
        To configure custom behavior for certain methods, subclass `WaybackMiddleware` and override the `get_item_urls` method to pull additional links to archive from individual items or `handle_wayback` to change how responses from the Wayback Machine are handled.
