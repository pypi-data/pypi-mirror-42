Description: 
        
        **Lino Così** is a free desktop-like web accounting application.  It
        is targeted to small and expanding enterprises or organisations who
        want more than an off-the-shelf product.  With Lino Così you will
        finally perceive it as a joy to
        
        - manage your contacts, your catalog of products and your account
          chart
        - record and print your sales invoices
        - record your purchase invoices
        - declare your VAT statement
        - record your bank statements
        - get your financial situation
        
        Lino Così is **almost ready for use**.  Despite the fact that Lino
        Così itself keeps things simple, its codebase is **used by more
        sophisticated applications** like `Lino Welfare
        <http://welfare.lino-framework.org>`__ or `Lino Voga
        <http://voga.lino-framework.org>`__.
