Description: ==============
         AWS-Datapipe
        ==============
        
        A tool for creating AWS data pipeline. Currently only for **exporting data from any DynamoDB table to an existing S3 bucket** 
        and store the Pipeline Definition as a backup. New features are going to be added (check for updates).
        
        `Just because terraform can't do it yet..`
        
        ---------------
         Prerequisites
        ---------------
        
        **This tool supports only Python 3 because Python 2.7 will not be maintained past 2020**
        
        AWS-Datapipe uses awscli to configure pipelines in your AWS account. By default, installing aws-datapipe you will also
        install all the prerequisites, so you can skip this phase and move to the `Installation step`. But in case if you want to do it manually:
        
        The easiest way to install aws-cli is to use `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ in a ``virtualenv``::
        
            $ pip install awscli
        
        or, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``, to install globally::
        
            $ sudo pip install awscli
        
        or for your user::
        
            $ pip install --user awscli
        
        If you have the aws-cli installed and want to upgrade to the latest version
        you can run::
        
            $ pip install --upgrade awscli
        
        Because aws-datapipe is based on aws-cli, before using aws-datapipe, 
        you need to configure your AWS credentials using aws-cli.  
        You can do this in several ways:
        
        * Environment variables
        * Shared credentials file
        * Config file
        * IAM Role
        
        The quickest way to get started is to run the ``aws configure`` command::
        
            $ aws configure
            AWS Access Key ID: foo
            AWS Secret Access Key: bar
            Default region name [us-west-2]: us-west-2
            Default output format [None]: json
        
        For additional info and other ways of aws-cli configuration you can check `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html>`_

         Installing
        ---------------
        
        The easiest way to install aws-datapipe is to use `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ in a ``virtualenv``::
        
            $ pip install aws-datapipe
        
        or, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``, to install globally::
        
            $ sudo pip install aws-datapipe
        
        or for your user::
        
            $ pip install --user aws-datapipe
        
        If you have the aws-datapipe installed and want to upgrade to the latest version
        you can run::
        
            $ pip install --upgrade aws-datapipe
        
        
        End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
        
        ---------------
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        You can use AWS Datapipe in two different ways: 
        
        * interactive
        * passing arguments
        
        To list all available arguments and additional info check please the ``--help``.
        
        For interactive mode just start the tool ``aws-datapipe`` and it will ask you for the required information to build a pipeline.
        
        After creating data pipeline in AWS, datapipe will save locally a `pipeline definition file` with the same name as your 
        pipeline that can be used as a backup. After that you can activate the pipeline directly in the script on the next step:
        
        ``Would you like to activate the pipeline now? [y/n]``  
        
        You can omit activation and manually activate the pipeline later whenever you want from the AWS Console
        
        Currently ``aws-datapipe`` is creating pipeline which will **run every 14 days after activation**. 
        
        Schedule configuration is coming soon.. check for updates
