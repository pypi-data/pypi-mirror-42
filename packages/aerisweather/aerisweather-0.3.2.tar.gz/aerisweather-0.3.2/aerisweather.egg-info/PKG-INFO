        ---------------------
        
        The AerisWeather Python SDK allows a developer to quickly and easily add
        weather content and functionality to their Python applications.
        
        It utilizes the Aeris API backend for data loading and is built on
        top of an object mapping system that efficiently loads requested
        weather content into third-party Python applications, greatly
        reducing the amount of code and development needed on the developer end.
        
        The AerisWeather Python SDK is built using Python v3.6.
