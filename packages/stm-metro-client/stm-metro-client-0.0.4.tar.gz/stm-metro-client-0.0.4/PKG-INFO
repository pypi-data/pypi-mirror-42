Description: # stm-metro-client
        
        A python client for the Montreal STM Metro line status.
        
        I created this library to feed data to sensors for STM line status in my HomeAssistant based home automation setup.
        
        Data is provided by the STM through a public xml feed found at http://www2.stm.info/1997/alertesmetro/esm.xml
        
        DISCLAIMER: I am not affiliated to the STM, and bear no responsibility to the data provided by this library/API.
        
        Install using pip:
        
        pip3 install stm-metro-client
