NAME
    uncompress - decompress files compressed using LZW algorithm

SYNOPSIS
    uncompress [-v] [-r] [-k] [-t] [-d] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Decompress files previously compressed using LZW algorithm.

    Replaces the compressed files with the uncompressed ones,
    removing the extension ".Z".

    The files are decompressed only if they end with the extension ".Z",
    this is convenient for use the compressor and the decompressor on the
    same directory recursively and avoid to care if the compressor actually
    has created ".Z" files or kept the original files.

    -r
        Recursively decompress the files inside the directories
        within the given file list.
        If not specified, directories in the file list are skipped.

    -v
        Prints information about the handled files.

    -t
        Prints the time spent for decompress each file.

    -k
        Keeps the decompressed files after the decompression.

    -d
        Prints debug messages.
