LZW3
====

Compressor and decompressor that uses `LZW
algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch>`__
written in Python3.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Requires at least Python 3.5.

INSTALLATION
------------

::

    pip install lzw3

USAGE
-----

Two scripts will be installed in your local binary path (e.g.
``/home/user/.local/bin``): ``compress`` and ``uncompress``. If you want
to invoke these scripts, ensure that your ``$PATH`` contains the python
binary path Note that this compressor just compress regular files (i.e.
doesn't create an archive such as .zip or .tar.gz). Anyhow, directory
can still be compressed using the option: ``-r``

Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~

The compression phases replaces the original files with the compressed
ones, appending the extension ".Z"

Compress a list of files:

::

    python3 -m lzw3.compressor doc1.txt doc2.txt

Compress a directory recursively:

::

    python3 -m lzw3.compressor -r /home/user/Docs/Project

Alternatively you can user the ``compress`` script as follows:

::

    compress doc1.txt doc2.txt

Options
^^^^^^^

::

        -r
            Recursively compress the files inside the directories
            within the given file list.
            If not specified, directories in the file list are skipped.

        -v
            Prints information about the handled files and the percentage of
            saved space for each compressed file.

        -t
            Prints the time spent for compress each file.

        -k
            Keeps the original files instead of replace those with the
            compressed ones.

        -f
            Force to compress and keep the compressed file, even if the size
            of the compressed file is higher than the size of the original one.

        -d
            Prints debug messages.

Decompression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The decompression phases replaces the compressed files (with extension
".Z") with the uncompressed ones.

Decompress a list of files:

::

    python3 -m lzw3.decompressor doc1.txt.Z doc2.txt.Z

Decompress a directory recursively:

::

    python3 -m lzw3.decompressor -r /home/user/Docs/Project

Alternatively you can user the ``uncompress`` script as follows:

::

    uncompress doc1.txt.Z doc2.txt.Z

Options
^^^^^^^

::

        -r
            Recursively decompress the files inside the directories
            within the given file list.
            If not specified, directories in the file list are skipped.

        -v
            Prints information about the handled files.

        -t
            Prints the time spent for decompress each file.

        -k
            Keeps the decompressed files after the decompression.

        -f
            Force to decompress the files even if the file name 
            doesn't end with ".Z".

        -d
            Prints debug messages.

TESTING
-------

The project comes with few unit tests, both on static or random
generated files. To run the tests use:

::

    python3 setup.py test
