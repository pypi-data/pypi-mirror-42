NAME
    uncompress - decompress files compressed using LZW algorithm

SYNOPSIS
    uncompress [-v] [-r] [-k] [-t] [-d] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Decompress files previously compressed using LZW algorithm.

    Replaces the compressed files with the uncompressed ones,
    removing the extension ".Z".

    The files are decompressed only if they end with the extension ".Z"
    (unless -f is specified); this is convenient for use the compressor
    and the decompressor on the same directory recursively and avoid to care
    if the compressor actually has created ".Z" files or kept the original files.

    -r
        Recursively decompress the files inside the directories
        within the given file list.
        If not specified, directories in the file list are skipped.

    -v
        Prints information about the handled files.

    -t
        Prints the time spent for decompress each file.

    -k
        Keeps the decompressed files after the decompression.

    -f
        Force to decompress the files even if the file name
        doesn't end with ".Z".

    -d
        Prints debug messages.

EXAMPLES

    Decompress a directory recursively:
        uncompress -r /home/user/Docs/Project

    Decompress a list of files:
        uncompress /home/user/Docs/f1.txt /home/user/Docs/f2.txt
