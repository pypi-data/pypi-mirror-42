# Functional Pipeline

Functional languages like Haskell, Elixir, and Elm have pipe functions that allow
the results of one function to be passed to the next function. 

Using functions from `functools`, we can build composition in python, however it is not
nearly as elegant as a well thought out pipeline. 

This library is designed to make the creation of a functional pipeline easier in python.

```python 
from operators import add, multiply
from functional_pipeline import pipeline, tap

result = pipeline(
    10,
    [
        (add, 1),
        (multiply, 2)
    ]
)
print(result)  # 22
```

This pattern can be extended for easily dealing with lists or generators.

```python
from functional_pipeline import pipeline, String

names = [
    "John",
    "James",
    "Bill",
    "Tiffany",
    "Jamie",
]

```
