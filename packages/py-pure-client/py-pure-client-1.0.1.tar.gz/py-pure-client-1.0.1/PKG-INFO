Description: # py-pure-client
        Pure Storage Python Clients for Pure1, FlashArray, and FlashBlade APIs.
        
        ## Overview
        
        The Python package has clients that use the Pure1, FlashArray, and FlashBlade APIs. Currently, only Pure1 is supported; FlashArray and FlashBlade will be added in the future.
        
        For the current FlashArray client, [see here](https://github.com/PureStorage-OpenConnect/rest-client), and for the current FlashBlade client, [see here](https://github.com/purestorage/purity_fb_python_client).
        
        The Pure1 client gives a simple interface to the Pure1 Manage public API.
        
        ## Requirements
        The library requires Python 2.7 and higher or Python 3.3 and higher. Third-party libraries are also required.
