        ==============
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        privacyscanner is distributed via PyPI and can be easily installed using pip:
        
            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            pip install privacyscanner
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Before first use, you have to download the dependencies of privacyscanner.
        These include the MaxMind GeoIP2 database and the Easylist adblock lists.
        For convenience, most dependencies can be downloaded with:
        
            privacyscanner update_dependencies
        
        Those dependencies will be stored in `~/.local/share/privacyscanner`. In
        addition, google-chrome or chromium have to be installed and available in
        your PATH.
        
        Scanning a single website, e.g. http://example.com/, can be done by running:
        
            privacyscanner scan http://example.com/
        
        It will output the scan result in Python object syntax and it will create a
        directory for the website in your current working directory. This directory
        contains the scan result as JSON file as well as associated files (e.g. the
        screenshot of the site) and the corresponding log files of the scan.
        
        For more details, see `privacyscanner --help` and dive into the source :-)
