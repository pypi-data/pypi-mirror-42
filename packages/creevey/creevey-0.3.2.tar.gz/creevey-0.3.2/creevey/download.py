    Download images and save as PNGs

    By default, each file is written to the working directory, with
    the filename in the URL and a ".png" extension. The `outdir`
    argument can be used to change to output directory while still using
    the filename in the URL and a ".png" extension. Alternatively, the
    `path_func` argument can be used to construct the output path from
    the input URL in any way you wish.

    Parameters
    ----------
    urls
        URLs of images to download
    outdir
        Desired output directory. Must be `None` if `path_func` is not
        `None`.
    path_func
        Function that takes a URL and returns the desired path for a
        local copy of the associated resource. Must be `None` if
        `outdir` is not `None`.
    skip_existing
        If True, skip any file for which the output path matches an
        existing file path. If False, overwrite such files. Either way,
        log an appropriate warning.
    write_log_path
        Desired path for logs of successful writes
    n_jobs
        Number of jobs to run in parallel
    resize_shape: int or tuple
        Desired final image dimensions to resize to. Default is None
        which will not change image size on download. a single int
        will make a square of that size. a tuple will create a custom
        (height, width) rectangle.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError if neither `outdir` nor `path_func` is `None`.
