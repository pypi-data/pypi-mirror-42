This is a set of ansible playbooks and supporting code to test the
deployment of Avocado in a number of different environments, and
installed via a number of different methods.  These are intended to be
used as regular playbooks, so roughly the following steps should be
followed:

 1) Install ansible.  If you need help, refer to
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide

 2) Adjust your inventory, that is, the hosts that will be used on the
    playbook execution.  The simplest way is to edit the inventory
    file this directory.

 3) (OPTIONAL) adjust your configuration on vars.yml

 4) Run a playbook with: ansible-playbook <PLAYBOOK_FILE_NAME>

The following playbooks Ansible are available here:

 - pip-git.yml: deployment Avocado using pip, from a GIT repository,
   on a Python virtual environment.
