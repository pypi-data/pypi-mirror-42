        Thumbor URL Aliases plugin
        ==========================
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/bluekiri/thumbor-aliases.svg?branch=master
        **thumbor_aliases** let's you create custom urls to redirect your most-used request
        using a friendly url.
        
        Imagine that your company decides that all thumbnails should go to ``100x100/smart``.
        
        Wouldn't be awesome to just name this url: ``thumbnail``? So, if you need to change
        it later, you can even just modify the alias to point to ``200x200/smart`` instead,
        without having to change your application code.
        
        
        Install
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        Before installing, be sure you're using Python2.7 (Python3 isn't supported yet).
        
        Install it by using pip::
        
          $  pip install thumbor-aliases
         
        Easy, right?
        
        Configure
        ^^^^^^^^^
        Create, if not done yet, your thumbor config file::
        
          $ thumbor-config > config.cfg
          
        And enable **thumbor_aliases** plugin on community extensions. This can be done by
        just adding next lines at the end of configuration file::
        
          COMMUNITY_EXTENSIONS = [
            'thumbor_aliases',
            ...
          ]
        
        By default it will use the ``yaml_file`` storage handler, which reads a file located on ``~/aliases.yml``.
        
        In case you want to change the file location, you can set the config variable: ``ALIASES_STORAGE_FILE`` ::
        
          ALIASES_STORAGE_FILE = "~/your_custom_filename.yml"
          
        The YAML file should follow next format::
        
          alias: "url/to/redirect"
          
        For example::
        
          thumbnail: "100x100/smart"
          header: "800x200/smart"
          
        And in order to finally execute the app and let the magic happen, run next command::
        
          $ thumbor --conf=your_thumbor_config.cfg -a tc_core.app.App
