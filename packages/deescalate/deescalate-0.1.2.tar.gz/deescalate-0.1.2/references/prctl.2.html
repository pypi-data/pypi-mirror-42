       <b>prctl</b>() is called with a first argument describing what to do (with
       values defined in <i>&lt;linux/prctl.h&gt;</i>), and further arguments with a
       significance depending on the first one.  The first argument can be:

       <b>PR_CAPBSET_READ </b>(since Linux 2.6.25)
              Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified
              in <i>arg2</i> is in the calling thread's capability bounding set, or
              0 if it is not.  (The capability constants are defined in
              <i>&lt;linux/capability.h&gt;</i>.)  The capability bounding set dictates
              whether the process can receive the capability through a
              file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to
              <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              If the capability specified in <i>arg2</i> is not valid, then the
              call fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

       <b>PR_CAPBSET_DROP </b>(since Linux 2.6.25)
              If the calling thread has the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability, then
              drop the capability specified by <i>arg2</i> from the calling
              thread's capability bounding set.  Any children of the calling
              thread will inherit the newly reduced bounding set.

              The call fails with the error: <b>EPERM </b>if the calling thread
              does not have the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>; <b>EINVAL </b>if <i>arg2</i> does not
              represent a valid capability; or <b>EINVAL </b>if file capabilities
              are not enabled in the kernel, in which case bounding sets are
              not supported.

       <b>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              If <i>arg2</i> is nonzero, set the "child subreaper" attribute of the
              calling process; if <i>arg2</i> is zero, unset the attribute.  When a
              process is marked as a child subreaper, all of the children
              that it creates, and their descendants, will be marked as
              having a subreaper.  In effect, a subreaper fulfills the role
              of <a href="../man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a> for its descendant processes.  Upon termination of
              a process that is orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent has
              already terminated) and marked as having a subreaper, the
              nearest still living ancestor subreaper will receive a <b>SIGCHLD</b>
              signal and be able to <a href="../man2/wait.2.html">wait(2)</a> on the process to discover its
              termination status.

       <b>PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              Return the "child subreaper" setting of the caller, in the
              location pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE </b>(since Linux 2.3.20)
              Set the state of the "dumpable" flag, which determines whether
              core dumps are produced for the calling process upon delivery
              of a signal whose default behavior is to produce a core dump.

              In kernels up to and including 2.6.12, <i>arg2</i> must be either 0
              (<b>SUID_DUMP_DISABLE</b>, process is not dumpable) or 1
              (<b>SUID_DUMP_USER</b>, process is dumpable).  Between kernels 2.6.13
              and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted, which caused any
              binary which normally would not be dumped to be dumped
              readable by root only; for security reasons, this feature has
              been removed.  (See also the description of <i>/proc/sys/fs/</i>
              <i>suid_dumpable</i> in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.)

              Normally, this flag is set to 1.  However, it is reset to the
              current value contained in the file <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i>
              (which by default has the value 0), if any of the following
              attributes of the process are changed by the operations listed
              below:

              *  The effective user or group ID is changed.

              *  The filesystem user or group ID is changed (see
                 <a href="../man7/credentials.7.html">credentials(7)</a>).

              *  The process's set of permitted capabilities (see
                 <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>) is changed such that its new set of
                 capabilities is not a subset of its previous set of
                 capabilities.

              The operations that may trigger changes to the dumpable flag
              include:

              *  execution (<a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>) of a set-user-ID or set-group-ID
                 program, or a program that has capabilities (see
                 <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>);

              *  <a href="../man2/capset.2.html">capset(2)</a>; and

              *  system calls that change process credentials (<a href="../man2/setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a>
                 <a href="../man2/setgid.2.html">setgid(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/setresuid.2.html">setresuid(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/setresgid.2.html">setresgid(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a>, and so
                 on).

              Processes that are not dumpable can not be attached via
              <a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a> <b>PTRACE_ATTACH</b>.

       <b>PR_GET_DUMPABLE </b>(since Linux 2.3.20)
              Return (as the function result) the current state of the
              calling process's dumpable flag.

       <b>PR_SET_ENDIAN </b>(since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given
              in <i>arg2</i>, which should be one of the following: <b>PR_ENDIAN_BIG</b>,
              <b>PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE</b>, or <b>PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE </b>(PowerPC pseudo
              little endian).

       <b>PR_GET_ENDIAN </b>(since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Return the endian-ness of the calling process, in the location
              pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_FPEMU </b>(since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Set floating-point emulation control bits to <i>arg2</i>.  Pass
              <b>PR_FPEMU_NOPRINT </b>to silently emulate floating-point operation
              accesses, or <b>PR_FPEMU_SIGFPE </b>to not emulate floating-point
              operations and send <b>SIGFPE </b>instead.

       <b>PR_GET_FPEMU </b>(since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Return floating-point emulation control bits, in the location
              pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_FPEXC </b>(since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Set floating-point exception mode to <i>arg2</i>.  Pass
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE </b>to use FPEXC for FP exception enables,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_DIV </b>for floating-point divide by zero, <b>PR_FP_EXC_OVF</b>
              for floating-point overflow, <b>PR_FP_EXC_UND </b>for floating-point
              underflow, <b>PR_FP_EXC_RES </b>for floating-point inexact result,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_INV </b>for floating-point invalid operation,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_DISABLED </b>for FP exceptions disabled,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV </b>for async nonrecoverable exception mode,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_ASYNC </b>for async recoverable exception mode,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_PRECISE </b>for precise exception mode.

       <b>PR_GET_FPEXC </b>(since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Return floating-point exception mode, in the location pointed
              to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS </b>(since Linux 2.2.18)
              Set the state of the thread's "keep capabilities" flag, which
              determines whether the threads's permitted capability set is
              cleared when a change is made to the threads's user IDs such
              that the threads's real UID, effective UID, and saved set-
              user-ID all become nonzero when at least one of them
              previously had the value 0.  By default, the permitted
              capability set is cleared when such a change is made; setting
              the "keep capabilities" flag prevents it from being cleared.
              <i>arg2</i> must be either 0 (permitted capabilities are cleared) or
              1 (permitted capabilities are kept).  (A thread's <i>effective</i>
              capability set is always cleared when such a credential change
              is made, regardless of the setting of the "keep capabilities"
              flag.)  The "keep capabilities" value will be reset to 0 on
              subsequent calls to <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS </b>(since Linux 2.2.18)
              Return (as the function result) the current state of the
              calling threads's "keep capabilities" flag.

       <b>PR_SET_NAME </b>(since Linux 2.6.9)
              Set the name of the calling thread, using the value in the
              location pointed to by <i>(char *) arg2</i>.  The name can be up to
              16 bytes long, including the terminating null byte.  (If the
              length of the string, including the terminating null byte,
              exceeds 16 bytes, the string is silently truncated.)  This is
              the same attribute that can be set via <a href="../man3/pthread_setname_np.3.html">pthread_setname_np(3)</a>
              and retrieved using <a href="../man3/pthread_getname_np.3.html">pthread_getname_np(3)</a>.  The attribute is
              likewise accessible via <i>/proc/self/task/[tid]/comm</i>, where <i>tid</i>
              is the name of the calling thread.

       <b>PR_GET_NAME </b>(since Linux 2.6.11)
              Return the name of the calling thread, in the buffer pointed
              to by <i>(char *) arg2</i>.  The buffer should allow space for up to
              16 bytes; the returned string will be null-terminated.

       <b>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              Set the calling process's <i>no_new_privs</i> bit to the value in
              <i>arg2</i>.  With <i>no_new_privs</i> set to 1, <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> promises not to
              grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done
              without the <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> call (for example, rendering the set-
              user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and file capabilities non-
              functional).  Once set, this bit cannot be unset.  The setting
              of this bit is inherited by children created by <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and
              <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>, and preserved across <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              For more information, see the kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt</i>.

       <b>PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              Return (as the function result) the value of the <i>no_new_privs</i>
              bit for the current process.  A value of 0 indicates the
              regular <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> behavior.  A value of 1 indicates <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>
              will operate in the privilege-restricting mode described
              above.

       <b>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG </b>(since Linux 2.1.57)
              Set the parent death signal of the calling process to <i>arg2</i>
              (either a signal value in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).
              This is the signal that the calling process will get when its
              parent dies.  This value is cleared for the child of a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
              and (since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23) when executing a set-user-ID
              or set-group-ID binary, or a binary that has associated
              capabilities (see <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>).  This value is preserved
              across <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              <i>Warning</i>: the "parent" in this case is considered to be the
              <i>thread</i> that created this process.  In other words, the signal
              will be sent when that thread terminates (via, for example,
              <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit(3)</a>), rather than after all of the threads in the
              parent process terminate.

       <b>PR_GET_PDEATHSIG </b>(since Linux 2.3.15)
              Return the current value of the parent process death signal,
              in the location pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_PTRACER </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              This is meaningful only when the Yama LSM is enabled and in
              mode 1 ("restricted ptrace", visible via
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</i>).  When a "ptracer process
              ID" is passed in <i>arg2</i>, the caller is declaring that the
              ptracer process can <a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a> the calling process as if it
              were a direct process ancestor.  Each <b>PR_SET_PTRACER </b>operation
              replaces the previous "ptracer process ID".  Employing
              <b>PR_SET_PTRACER </b>with <i>arg2</i> set to 0 clears the caller's "ptracer
              process ID".  If <i>arg2</i> is <b>PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY</b>, the ptrace
              restrictions introduced by Yama are effectively disabled for
              the calling process.

              For further information, see the kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/security/Yama.txt</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_SECCOMP </b>(since Linux 2.6.23)
              Set the secure computing (seccomp) mode for the calling
              thread, to limit the available system calls.  The more recent
              <a href="../man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a> system call provides a superset of the
              functionality of <b>PR_SET_SECCOMP</b>.

              The seccomp mode is selected via <i>arg2</i>.  (The seccomp constants
              are defined in <i>&lt;linux/seccomp.h&gt;</i>.)

              With <i>arg2</i> set to <b>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</b>, the only system calls
              that the thread is permitted to make are <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>,
              <a href="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit(2)</a> (but not <a href="../man2/exit_group.2.html">exit_group(2)</a>), and <a href="../man2/sigreturn.2.html">sigreturn(2)</a>.  Other
              system calls result in the delivery of a <b>SIGKILL </b>signal.
              Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching
              applications that may need to execute untrusted byte code,
              perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.  This
              operation is available only if the kernel is configured with
              <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP </b>enabled.

              With <i>arg2</i> set to <b>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER </b>(since Linux 3.5), the
              system calls allowed are defined by a pointer to a Berkeley
              Packet Filter passed in <i>arg3</i>.  This argument is a pointer to
              <i>struct sock_fprog</i>; it can be designed to filter arbitrary

       <b>PR_GET_SECCOMP </b>(since Linux 2.6.23)
              Return (as the function result) the secure computing mode of
              the calling thread.  If the caller is not in secure computing
              mode, this operation returns 0; if the caller is in strict
              secure computing mode, then the <b>prctl</b>() call will cause a
              <b>SIGKILL </b>signal to be sent to the process.  If the caller is in
              filter mode, and this system call is allowed by the seccomp
              filters, it returns 2; otherwise, the process is killed with a
              <b>SIGKILL </b>signal.  This operation is available only if the
              kernel is configured with <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP </b>enabled.

              Since Linux 3.8, the <i>Seccomp</i> field of the <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i>
              file provides a method of obtaining the same information,
              without the risk that the process is killed; see <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>PR_SET_SECUREBITS </b>(since Linux 2.6.26)
              Set the "securebits" flags of the calling thread to the value
              supplied in <i>arg2</i>.  See <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_SECUREBITS </b>(since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return (as the function result) the "securebits" flags of the
              calling thread.  See <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.

       <b>PR_SET_THP_DISABLE </b>(since Linux 3.15)
              Set the state of the "THP disable" flag for the calling
              thread.  If <i>arg2</i> has a nonzero value, the flag is set,
              otherwise it is cleared.  Setting this flag provides a method
              for disabling transparent huge pages for jobs where the code
              cannot be modified, and using a malloc hook with <a href="../man2/madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a> is
              not an option (i.e., statically allocated data).  The setting
              of the "THP disable" flag is inherited by a child created via
              <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and is preserved across <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_THP_DISABLE </b>(since Linux 3.15)
              Return (via the function result) the current setting of the
              "THP disable" flag for the calling thread: either 1, if the
              flag is set, or 0, if it is not.

       <b>PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              Retrieve the <i>clear_child_tid</i> address set by <a href="../man2/set_tid_address.2.html">set_tid_address(2)</a>
              and the <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> <b>CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID </b>flag, in the location
              pointed to by <i>(int **) arg2</i>.  This feature is available only
              if the kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</b>
              option enabled.

       <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK </b>(since Linux 2.6.28)
              Set the current timer slack for the calling thread to the
              nanosecond value supplied in <i>arg2</i>.  If <i>arg2</i> is less than or
              equal to zero, reset the current timer slack to the thread's
              default timer slack value.  The timer slack is used by the
              kernel to group timer expirations for the calling thread that
              are close to one another; as a consequence, timer expirations
              for the thread may be up to the specified number of
              nanoseconds late (but will never expire early).  Grouping
              timer expirations can help reduce system power consumption by
              minimizing CPU wake-ups.

              The timer expirations affected by timer slack are those set by
              <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/pselect.2.html">pselect(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/ppoll.2.html">ppoll(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>,

              (and thus the library functions implemented via futexes,

              <b>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</b>(3), and <a href="../man3/sem_timedwait.3.html">sem_timedwait(3)</a>).

              Timer slack is not applied to threads that are scheduled under
              a real-time scheduling policy (see <a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler(2)</a>).

              Each thread has two associated timer slack values: a "default"
              value, and a "current" value.  The current value is the one
              that governs grouping of timer expirations.  When a new thread
              is created, the two timer slack values are made the same as
              the current value of the creating thread.  Thereafter, a
              thread can adjust its current timer slack value via
              <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK </b>(the default value can't be changed).  The
              timer slack values of <i>init</i> (PID 1), the ancestor of all
              processes, are 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).  The
              timer slack values are preserved across <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_TIMERSLACK </b>(since Linux 2.6.28)
              Return (as the function result) the current timer slack value
              of the calling thread.

       <b>PR_SET_TIMING </b>(since Linux 2.6.0-test4)

              <b>PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL </b>or <b>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP </b>to <i>arg2</i>.
              <b>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP </b>is not currently implemented (attempting
              to set this mode will yield the error <b>EINVAL</b>).

       <b>PR_GET_TIMING </b>(since Linux 2.6.0-test4)

       <b>PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.31)
              Disable all performance counters attached to the calling

              this process or another process.  Performance counters created
              by the calling process for other processes are unaffected.
              For more information on performance counters, see the Linux

              or the system-wide default (<b>PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT</b>).  Early kill
              means that the thread receives a <b>SIGBUS </b>signal as soon as

              This feature is available only if the kernel is built with the

              The following options are available since Linux 3.5.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</b>
                     Set the address above which the program command line is

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</b>
                     Set the address below which the program command line is
                     placed.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</b>
                     Set the address above which the program environment is
                     placed.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END</b>
                     Set the address below which the program environment is
                     placed.

                     The address passed with <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</b>,
                     <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</b>, <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</b>, and
                     <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END </b>should belong to a process stack
                     area.  Thus, the corresponding memory area must be
                     readable, writable, and (depending on the kernel
                     configuration) have the <b>MAP_GROWSDOWN </b>attribute set
                     (see <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).

              <b>PR_SET_MM_AUXV</b>
                     Set a new auxiliary vector.  The <i>arg3</i> argument should
                     provide the address of the vector.  The <i>arg4</i> is the
                     size of the vector.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE</b>
                     Supersede the <i>/proc/pid/exe</i> symbolic link with a new
                     one pointing to a new executable file identified by the
                     file descriptor provided in <i>arg3</i> argument.  The file
                     descriptor should be obtained with a regular <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a>
                     call.

                     To change the symbolic link, one needs to unmap all
                     existing executable memory areas, including those
                     created by the kernel itself (for example the kernel
                     usually creates at least one executable memory area for
                     the ELF <i>.text</i> section).

                     The second limitation is that such transitions can be
                     done only once in a process life time.  Any further
                     attempts will be rejected.  This should help system
                     administrators monitor unusual symbolic-link
                     transitions over all processes running on a system.

       <b>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</b>, <b>PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT </b>(since Linux
       3.19)
              Enable or disable kernel management of Memory Protection
              eXtensions (MPX) bounds tables.  The <i>arg2</i>, <i>arg3</i>, <i>arg4</i>, and
              <i>arg5</i> arguments must be zero.

              MPX is a hardware-assisted mechanism for performing bounds
              checking on pointers.  It consists of a set of registers
              storing bounds information and a set of special instruction
              prefixes that tell the CPU on which instructions it should do
              bounds enforcement.  There is a limited number of these
              registers and when there are more pointers than registers,
              their contents must be "spilled" into a set of tables.  These
              tables are called "bounds tables" and the MPX <b>prctl</b>()
              operations control whether the kernel manages their allocation
              and freeing.

              When management is enabled, the kernel will take over
              allocation and freeing of the bounds tables.  It does this by
              trapping the #BR exceptions that result at first use of
              missing bounds tables and instead of delivering the exception
              to user space, it allocates the table and populates the bounds
              directory with the location of the new table.  For freeing,
              the kernel checks to see if bounds tables are present for
              memory which is not allocated, and frees them if so.

              Before enabling MPX management using <b>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</b>,
              the application must first have allocated a user-space buffer
              for the bounds directory and placed the location of that
              directory in the <i>bndcfgu</i> register.

              These calls will fail if the CPU or kernel does not support
              MPX.  Kernel support for MPX is enabled via the
              <b>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MPX </b>configuration option.  You can check
              whether the CPU supports MPX by looking for the 'mpx' CPUID
              bit, like with the following command:

                   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep ' mpx '

              A thread may not switch in or out of long (64-bit) mode while
              MPX is enabled.

              All threads in a process are affected by these calls.

              The child of a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> inherits the state of MPX management.
              During <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, MPX management is reset to a state as if
              <b>PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT </b>had been called.

              For further information on Intel MPX, see the kernel source
              file <i>Documentation/x86/intel_mpx.txt</i>.
