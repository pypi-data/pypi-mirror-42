       For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX
       implementations distinguish two categories of processes: <i>privileged</i>
       processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or
       root), and <i>unprivileged</i> processes (whose effective UID is nonzero).
       Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while
       unprivileged processes are subject to full permission checking based
       on the process's credentials (usually: effective UID, effective GID,
       and supplementary group list).

       Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally
       associated with superuser into distinct units, known as <i>capabilities</i>,
       which can be independently enabled and disabled.  Capabilities are a
       per-thread attribute.

   <b>Capabilities list</b>
       The following list shows the capabilities implemented on Linux, and
       the operations or behaviors that each capability permits:

       <b>CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL </b>(since Linux 2.6.11)
              Enable and disable kernel auditing; change auditing filter
              rules; retrieve auditing status and filtering rules.

       <b>CAP_AUDIT_READ </b>(since Linux 3.16)
              Allow reading the audit log via a multicast netlink socket.

       <b>CAP_AUDIT_WRITE </b>(since Linux 2.6.11)
              Write records to kernel auditing log.

       <b>CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              Employ features that can block system suspend (<a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>
              <b>EPOLLWAKEUP</b>, <i>/proc/sys/wake_lock</i>).

       <b>CAP_CHOWN</b>
              Make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs (see <a href="../man2/chown.2.html">chown(2)</a>).

       <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b>
              Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.  (DAC
              is an abbreviation of "discretionary access control".)

       <b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b>
              * Bypass file read permission checks and directory read and
                execute permission checks;
              * Invoke <a href="../man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html">open_by_handle_at(2)</a>.

       <b>CAP_FOWNER</b>
              * Bypass permission checks on operations that normally require
                the filesystem UID of the process to match the UID of the
                file (e.g., <a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</a>), excluding those operations
                covered by <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE </b>and <b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b>;
              * set extended file attributes (see <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr(1)</a>) on arbitrary
                files;
              * set Access Control Lists (ACLs) on arbitrary files;
              * ignore directory sticky bit on file deletion;
              * specify <b>O_NOATIME </b>for arbitrary files in <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a> and
                <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       <b>CAP_FSETID</b>
              Don't clear set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits when a file
              is modified; set the set-group-ID bit for a file whose GID
              does not match the filesystem or any of the supplementary GIDs
              of the calling process.

       <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>
              Lock memory (<a href="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/mlockall.2.html">mlockall(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/shmctl.2.html">shmctl(2)</a>).

       <b>CAP_IPC_OWNER</b>
              Bypass permission checks for operations on System V IPC
              objects.

       <b>CAP_KILL</b>
              Bypass permission checks for sending signals (see <a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)</a>).
              This includes use of the <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> <b>KDSIGACCEPT </b>operation.

       <b>CAP_LEASE </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              Establish leases on arbitrary files (see <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>).

       <b>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</b>
              Set the <b>FS_APPEND_FL </b>and <b>FS_IMMUTABLE_FL </b>inode flags (see
              <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr(1)</a>).

       <b>CAP_MAC_ADMIN </b>(since Linux 2.6.25)
              Override Mandatory Access Control (MAC).  Implemented for the
              Smack Linux Security Module (LSM).

       <b>CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE </b>(since Linux 2.6.25)
              Allow MAC configuration or state changes.  Implemented for the
              Smack LSM.

       <b>CAP_MKNOD </b>(since Linux 2.4)
              Create special files using <a href="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod(2)</a>.

       <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
              Perform various network-related operations:
              * interface configuration;
              * administration of IP firewall, masquerading, and accounting;
              * modify routing tables;
              * bind to any address for transparent proxying;
              * set type-of-service (TOS)
              * clear driver statistics;
              * set promiscuous mode;
              * enabling multicasting;
              * use <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> to set the following socket options:
                <b>SO_DEBUG</b>, <b>SO_MARK</b>, <b>SO_PRIORITY </b>(for a priority outside the
                range 0 to 6), <b>SO_RCVBUFFORCE</b>, and <b>SO_SNDBUFFORCE</b>.

       <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</b>
              Bind a socket to Internet domain privileged ports (port
              numbers less than 1024).

       <b>CAP_NET_BROADCAST</b>
              (Unused)  Make socket broadcasts, and listen to multicasts.

       <b>CAP_NET_RAW</b>
              * use RAW and PACKET sockets;
              * bind to any address for transparent proxying.

       <b>CAP_SETGID</b>
              Make arbitrary manipulations of process GIDs and supplementary
              GID list; forge GID when passing socket credentials via UNIX
              domain sockets; write a group ID mapping in a user namespace
              (see <a href="../man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user_namespaces(7)</a>).

       <b>CAP_SETFCAP </b>(since Linux 2.6.24)
              Set file capabilities.

       <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>
              If file capabilities are not supported: grant or remove any
              capability in the caller's permitted capability set to or from
              any other process.  (This property of <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>is not
              available when the kernel is configured to support file
              capabilities, since <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>has entirely different
              semantics for such kernels.)

              If file capabilities are supported: add any capability from
              the calling thread's bounding set to its inheritable set; drop
              capabilities from the bounding set (via <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>
              <b>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</b>); make changes to the <i>securebits</i> flags.

              passing socket credentials via UNIX domain sockets; write a
              user ID mapping in a user namespace (see <a href="../man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user_namespaces(7)</a>).

       <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>

                including: <a href="../man2/quotactl.2.html">quotactl(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/umount.2.html">umount(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/swapon.2.html">swapon(2)</a>,
                setdomainname(2);
              * perform privileged <a href="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog(2)</a> operations (since Linux 2.6.37,

              * use lookup_dcookie(2);
              * use <a href="../man2/ioprio_set.2.html">ioprio_set(2)</a> to assign <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT </b>and (before
                Linux 2.6.25) <b>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE </b>I/O scheduling classes;
              * forge PID when passing socket credentials via UNIX domain
                sockets;
              * exceed <i>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</i>, the system-wide limit on the
                number of open files, in system calls that open files (e.g.,

              <b>CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM </b>and <b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM </b>timers).

   <b>Past and current implementation</b>
       A full implementation of capabilities requires that:

       1. For all privileged operations, the kernel must check whether the
          thread has the required capability in its effective set.

       2. The kernel must provide system calls allowing a thread's
          capability sets to be changed and retrieved.

       3. The filesystem must support attaching capabilities to an
          executable file, so that a process gains those capabilities when
          the file is executed.

       Before kernel 2.6.24, only the first two of these requirements are
       met; since kernel 2.6.24, all three requirements are met.

   <b>Thread capability sets</b>
       Each thread has three capability sets containing zero or more of the
       above capabilities:

       <i>Permitted</i>:
              This is a limiting superset for the effective capabilities
              that the thread may assume.  It is also a limiting superset
              for the capabilities that may be added to the inheritable set
              by a thread that does not have the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability in
              its effective set.

              If a thread drops a capability from its permitted set, it can
              never reacquire that capability (unless it <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>s either a
              set-user-ID-root program, or a program whose associated file
              capabilities grant that capability).

       <i>Inheritable</i>:
              This is a set of capabilities preserved across an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.
              It provides a mechanism for a process to assign capabilities
              to the permitted set of the new program during an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <i>Effective</i>:
              This is the set of capabilities used by the kernel to perform
              permission checks for the thread.

       A child created via <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> inherits copies of its parent's
       capability sets.  See below for a discussion of the treatment of
       capabilities during <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       Using <a href="../man2/capset.2.html">capset(2)</a>, a thread may manipulate its own capability sets (see
       below).

       Since Linux 3.2, the file <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap</i> exposes the
       numerical value of the highest capability supported by the running
       kernel; this can be used to determine the highest bit that may be set
       in a capability set.

   <b>File capabilities</b>
       Since kernel 2.6.24, the kernel supports associating capability sets
       with an executable file using <a href="../man8/setcap.8.html">setcap(8)</a>.  The file capability sets
       are stored in an extended attribute (see <a href="../man2/setxattr.2.html">setxattr(2)</a>) named
       <i>security.capability</i>.  Writing to this extended attribute requires the
       <b>CAP_SETFCAP </b>capability.  The file capability sets, in conjunction
       with the capability sets of the thread, determine the capabilities of
       a thread after an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       The three file capability sets are:

       <i>Permitted</i> (formerly known as <i>forced</i>):
              These capabilities are automatically permitted to the thread,
              regardless of the thread's inheritable capabilities.

       <i>Inheritable</i> (formerly known as <i>allowed</i>):
              This set is ANDed with the thread's inheritable set to
              determine which inheritable capabilities are enabled in the
              permitted set of the thread after the <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <i>Effective</i>:
              This is not a set, but rather just a single bit.  If this bit
              is set, then during an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> all of the new permitted
              capabilities for the thread are also raised in the effective
              set.  If this bit is not set, then after an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, none of
              the new permitted capabilities is in the new effective set.

              Enabling the file effective capability bit implies that any
              file permitted or inheritable capability that causes a thread
              to acquire the corresponding permitted capability during an
              <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> (see the transformation rules described below) will
              also acquire that capability in its effective set.  Therefore,
              when assigning capabilities to a file (<a href="../man8/setcap.8.html">setcap(8)</a>,
              <a href="../man3/cap_set_file.3.html">cap_set_file(3)</a>, <a href="../man3/cap_set_fd.3.html">cap_set_fd(3)</a>), if we specify the effective
              flag as being enabled for any capability, then the effective
              flag must also be specified as enabled for all other
              capabilities for which the corresponding permitted or
              inheritable flags is enabled.

   <b>Transformation of capabilities during execve()</b>
       During an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, the kernel calculates the new capabilities of
       the process using the following algorithm:

           P'(permitted) = (P(inheritable) &amp; F(inheritable)) |
                           (F(permitted) &amp; cap_bset)

           P'(effective) = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : 0

           P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

       where:

           P         denotes the value of a thread capability set before the
                     <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>

           P'        denotes the value of a capability set after the
                     <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>

           F         denotes a file capability set

           cap_bset  is the value of the capability bounding set (described
                     below).

   <b>Capabilities and execution of programs by root</b>
       In order to provide an all-powerful <i>root</i> using capability sets,
       during an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>:

       1. If a set-user-ID-root program is being executed, or the real user
          ID of the process is 0 (root) then the file inheritable and
          permitted sets are defined to be all ones (i.e., all capabilities
          enabled).

       2. If a set-user-ID-root program is being executed, then the file
          effective bit is defined to be one (enabled).

       The upshot of the above rules, combined with the capabilities
       transformations described above, is that when a process <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>s a
       set-user-ID-root program, or when a process with an effective UID of
       0 <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>s a program, it gains all capabilities in its permitted
       and effective capability sets, except those masked out by the
       capability bounding set.  This provides semantics that are the same
       as those provided by traditional UNIX systems.

   <b>Capability bounding set</b>
       The capability bounding set is a security mechanism that can be used
       to limit the capabilities that can be gained during an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.
       The bounding set is used in the following ways:

       * During an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, the capability bounding set is ANDed with the
         file permitted capability set, and the result of this operation is
         assigned to the thread's permitted capability set.  The capability
         bounding set thus places a limit on the permitted capabilities that
         may be granted by an executable file.

       * (Since Linux 2.6.25) The capability bounding set acts as a limiting
         superset for the capabilities that a thread can add to its
         inheritable set using <a href="../man2/capset.2.html">capset(2)</a>.  This means that if a capability
         is not in the bounding set, then a thread can't add this capability
         to its inheritable set, even if it was in its permitted
         capabilities, and thereby cannot have this capability preserved in
         its permitted set when it <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>s a file that has the capability
         in its inheritable set.

       Note that the bounding set masks the file permitted capabilities, but
       not the inherited capabilities.  If a thread maintains a capability
       in its inherited set that is not in its bounding set, then it can
       still gain that capability in its permitted set by executing a file
       that has the capability in its inherited set.

       Depending on the kernel version, the capability bounding set is
       either a system-wide attribute, or a per-process attribute.

       <b>Capability bounding set prior to Linux 2.6.25</b>

       In kernels before 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a system-
       wide attribute that affects all threads on the system.  The bounding
       set is accessible via the file <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>.
       (Confusingly, this bit mask parameter is expressed as a signed
       decimal number in <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>.)

       Only the <b>init </b>process may set capabilities in the capability bounding
       set; other than that, the superuser (more precisely: programs with
       the <b>CAP_SYS_MODULE </b>capability) may only clear capabilities from this
       set.

       On a standard system the capability bounding set always masks out the
       <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability.  To remove this restriction (dangerous!),
       modify the definition of <b>CAP_INIT_EFF_SET </b>in
       <i>include/linux/capability.h</i> and rebuild the kernel.

       The system-wide capability bounding set feature was added to Linux
       starting with kernel version 2.2.11.

       <b>Capability bounding set from Linux 2.6.25 onward</b>

       From Linux 2.6.25, the <i>capability bounding set</i> is a per-thread
       attribute.  (There is no longer a system-wide capability bounding
       set.)

       The bounding set is inherited at <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> from the thread's parent,
       and is preserved across an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       A thread may remove capabilities from its capability bounding set
       using the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_CAPBSET_DROP </b>operation, provided it has the
       <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability.  Once a capability has been dropped from the
       bounding set, it cannot be restored to that set.  A thread can
       determine if a capability is in its bounding set using the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>
       <b>PR_CAPBSET_READ </b>operation.

       Removing capabilities from the bounding set is supported only if file
       capabilities are compiled into the kernel.  In kernels before Linux
       2.6.33, file capabilities were an optional feature configurable via
       the <b>CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES </b>option.  Since Linux 2.6.33,
       the configuration option has been removed and file capabilities are
       always part of the kernel.  When file capabilities are compiled into
       the kernel, the <b>init </b>process (the ancestor of all processes) begins
       with a full bounding set.  If file capabilities are not compiled into
       the kernel, then <b>init </b>begins with a full bounding set minus
       <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>, because this capability has a different meaning when
       there are no file capabilities.

       Removing a capability from the bounding set does not remove it from
       the thread's inherited set.  However it does prevent the capability
       from being added back into the thread's inherited set in the future.

   <b>Effect of user ID changes on capabilities</b>
       To preserve the traditional semantics for transitions between 0 and
       nonzero user IDs, the kernel makes the following changes to a
       thread's capability sets on changes to the thread's real, effective,
       saved set, and filesystem user IDs (using <a href="../man2/setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/setresuid.2.html">setresuid(2)</a>, or
       similar):

       1. If one or more of the real, effective or saved set user IDs was
          previously 0, and as a result of the UID changes all of these IDs
          have a nonzero value, then all capabilities are cleared from the
          permitted and effective capability sets.

       2. If the effective user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero, then all
          capabilities are cleared from the effective set.

       3. If the effective user ID is changed from nonzero to 0, then the
          permitted set is copied to the effective set.

       4. If the filesystem user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero (see
          <a href="../man2/setfsuid.2.html">setfsuid(2)</a>), then the following capabilities are cleared from the
          effective set: <b>CAP_CHOWN</b>, <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b>, <b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b>,
          <b>CAP_FOWNER</b>, <b>CAP_FSETID</b>, <b>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.30),
          <b>CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE</b>, and <b>CAP_MKNOD </b>(since Linux 2.6.30).  If the
          filesystem UID is changed from nonzero to 0, then any of these
          capabilities that are enabled in the permitted set are enabled in
          the effective set.

       If a thread that has a 0 value for one or more of its user IDs wants
       to prevent its permitted capability set being cleared when it resets
       all of its user IDs to nonzero values, it can do so using the
       <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS </b>operation or the <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS </b>securebits
       flag described below.

   <b>Programmatically adjusting capability sets</b>
       A thread can retrieve and change its capability sets using the
       <a href="../man2/capget.2.html">capget(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/capset.2.html">capset(2)</a> system calls.  However, the use of
       <a href="../man3/cap_get_proc.3.html">cap_get_proc(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/cap_set_proc.3.html">cap_set_proc(3)</a>, both provided in the <i>libcap</i>
       package, is preferred for this purpose.  The following rules govern
       changes to the thread capability sets:

       1. If the caller does not have the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability, the new
          inheritable set must be a subset of the combination of the
          existing inheritable and permitted sets.

       2. (Since Linux 2.6.25) The new inheritable set must be a subset of
          the combination of the existing inheritable set and the capability
          bounding set.

       3. The new permitted set must be a subset of the existing permitted
          set (i.e., it is not possible to acquire permitted capabilities
          that the thread does not currently have).

       4. The new effective set must be a subset of the new permitted set.

   <b>The securebits flags: establishing a capabilities-only environment</b>
       Starting with kernel 2.6.26, and with a kernel in which file
       capabilities are enabled, Linux implements a set of per-thread
       <i>securebits</i> flags that can be used to disable special handling of
       capabilities for UID 0 (<i>root</i>).  These flags are as follows:

       <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b>
              Setting this flag allows a thread that has one or more 0 UIDs
              to retain its capabilities when it switches all of its UIDs to
              a nonzero value.  If this flag is not set, then such a UID
              switch causes the thread to lose all capabilities.  This flag
              is always cleared on an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  (This flag provides the
              same functionality as the older <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</b>
              operation.)

       <b>SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP</b>
              Setting this flag stops the kernel from adjusting capability
              sets when the threads's effective and filesystem UIDs are
              switched between zero and nonzero values.  (See the subsection
              <i>Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities</i>.)

       <b>SECBIT_NOROOT</b>
              If this bit is set, then the kernel does not grant
              capabilities when a set-user-ID-root program is executed, or
              when a process with an effective or real UID of 0 calls
              <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  (See the subsection <i>Capabilities and execution of</i>
              <i>programs by root</i>.)

       Each of the above "base" flags has a companion "locked" flag.
       Setting any of the "locked" flags is irreversible, and has the effect
       of preventing further changes to the corresponding "base" flag.  The
       locked flags are: <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED</b>,
       <b>SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED</b>, and <b>SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED</b>.

       The <i>securebits</i> flags can be modified and retrieved using the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>
       <b>PR_SET_SECUREBITS </b>and <b>PR_GET_SECUREBITS </b>operations.  The <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>
       capability is required to modify the flags.

       The <i>securebits</i> flags are inherited by child processes.  During an
       <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, all of the flags are preserved, except <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b>
       which is always cleared.

       An application can use the following call to lock itself, and all of
       its descendants, into an environment where the only way of gaining
       capabilities is by executing a program with associated file
       capabilities:

           prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS,
                   SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED |
                   SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP |
                   SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED |
                   SECBIT_NOROOT |
                   SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED);

       namespaces, see <a href="../man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user_namespaces(7)</a>.

       From kernel 2.5.27 to kernel 2.6.26, capabilities were an optional
       kernel component, and can be enabled/disabled via the
       <b>CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES </b>kernel configuration option.

       The <i>/proc/PID/task/TID/status</i> file can be used to view the capability
       sets of a thread.  The <i>/proc/PID/status</i> file shows the capability
       sets of a process's main thread.  Before Linux 3.8, nonexistent
       capabilities were shown as being enabled (1) in these sets.  Since
       Linux 3.8, all nonexistent capabilities (above <b>CAP_LAST_CAP</b>) are
       shown as disabled (0).

       The <i>libcap</i> package provides a suite of routines for setting and
       getting capabilities that is more comfortable and less likely to
       change than the interface provided by <a href="../man2/capset.2.html">capset(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/capget.2.html">capget(2)</a>.  This

       Before kernel 2.6.24, and from kernel 2.6.24 to kernel 2.6.32 if file
       capabilities are not enabled, a thread with the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capabil‐
       ity can manipulate the capabilities of threads other than itself.
       However, this is only theoretically possible, since no thread ever
       has <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>in either of these cases:

       * In the pre-2.6.25 implementation the system-wide capability bound‐
         ing set, <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>, always masks out this capabil‐
         ity, and this can not be changed without modifying the kernel
         source and rebuilding.

       * If file capabilities are disabled in the current implementation,
         then <b>init </b>starts out with this capability removed from its per-
         process bounding set, and that bounding set is inherited by all
         other processes created on the system.
