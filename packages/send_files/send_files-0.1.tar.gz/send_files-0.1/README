send_files: Copying files between computers
===========================================
send_files shares a directory by HTTP or receives file uploads into a directory
by HTTP. It starts the web server on the computer that you run it on, and tells
you what URLs you need to open on the other computer. You can configure some
security settings.

Usage
---------
Install ::

  pip install .

Then use the help flag to check documentation. ::

  python -m send_files send -help
  python -m send_files receive -help

Non-features
------------
TLS encryption (HTTPS) is not provided. My reasoning: If you need to use
send_files, you probably want self-signed certificate, and you will
likely only ever transfer files one time between any particular pair of
computers. The certificate will provide only a small security benefit,
and, more importantly, web browsers will give unreasonably scary
warnings about using the certificate.

If you want encryption, encrypt and rename the files before transferring
them.

Ambitions
---------
Perhaps some day this will be a context menu

1. Right-click on a selection in the popular GNOME/KDE file managers.
2. Click on "Publish directory" or "Receive files"
3. Start a web server that hosts the directory or receives files into
   the directory.
4. Provide the links that the recipients can use to access the files.
