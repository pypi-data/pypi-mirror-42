General Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a Python (2.7x) script that converts a numpy.ndarray containing a point cloud
(x, y, z) into a NetworkX graph.

The code also includes a function to extract shortest path information from a
graph. Any NetworkX method/function can be called from/on a graph
created with array_to_graph function.

This code was developed as part of my PhD research, supervised by Dr. Mat Disney,
in the Department of Geography at University College London (UCL). My research 
is funded through Science Without Borders from the National Council of Technological
and Scientific Development (10.13039/501100003593) â€“ Brazil (Process number 233849/2014-9).
