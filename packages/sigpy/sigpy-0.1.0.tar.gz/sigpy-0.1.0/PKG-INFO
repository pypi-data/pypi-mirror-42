        Overview
        ========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        SigPy is a package for signal processing, with emphasis on iterative methods. It is built to operate directly on numpy arrays on CPU and cupy arrays on GPU. Its main features include:
        
        * A unified CPU/GPU interface to signal processing functions, including convolution, FFT, NUFFT, wavelet transform, and thresholding functions.
        * Linear operator classes (``Linop``) that can do adjoint, addition, composing, and stacking.
        * Proximal operator classes (``Prox``) that can do stacking, and conjugation.
        * Iterative algorithm classes (``Alg``), including conjugate gradient, (accelerated/proximal) gradient method, and primal dual hybrid gradient.
        * Application classes (``App``) that wrap ``Alg``, ``Linop``, and ``Prox`` to form a final deliverable for each application.
        
        SigPy also provides a submodule sigpy.mri for MRI iterative reconstruction methods. Its main features include:
        
        * Commonly used MRI reconstruction methods as an ``App``: SENSE reconstruction, l1-wavelet reconstruction, total-variation reconstruction, and JSENSE reconstruction
        * Convenient simulation and sampling functions, including poisson-disc sampling function, and shepp-logan phantom generation function.
        
        Finally, SigPy provides a preliminary submodule sigpy.learn that implements convolutional sparse coding, and linear regression, using the core module.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The package can be installed via pip::
        
        	# (optional for CUDA support) pip install cupy
        	# (optional for MPI support) pip install mpi4py
        	pip install sigpy
        
        	
        Or via conda::
        
        	# (optional for CUDA support) conda install cupy
        	# (optional for MPI support) conda install mpi4py
        	conda install -c frankong sigpy
        
        Alternatively, the package can be installed from source with the following requirements:
        
        * python3
        * numpy
        * pywavelets
        * numba
