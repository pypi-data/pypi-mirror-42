### How do I get set up? ###

This code is compatible with Python3.5, and requires several modules. The requirements are available in `requirements.txt`. If you are doing a tar ball installation, do

```
python3.5 install -r requirements.txt
python3.5 install setup.py

```

If you are using a pip installation, simply do

```
python3.5 -m pip install paryopt
```

The publication related to the implementation can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04668).
