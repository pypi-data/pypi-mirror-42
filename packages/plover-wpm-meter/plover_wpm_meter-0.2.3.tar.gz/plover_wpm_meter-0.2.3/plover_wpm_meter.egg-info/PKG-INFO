        ================
        
        This is a plugin for Plover to display your typing speed as you type, in
        either or both of words per minute or strokes per minute:
        
        -  **Words per minute**: Shows the rate at which you stroked words in
           the last 10 and 60 seconds.
        -  **Strokes per minute**: Shows how efficiently you stroked words in
           the last 10 and 60 seconds. Lower values are more efficient, e.g. a
           value of 1 means that on average it took you one stroke to write out
           a word.
        
        A word is defined in one of three ways:
        
        -  **NCRA**: The `National Court Reporters Association`_ defines a
           “word” as 1.4 syllables. This is the measure used for official NCRA
           testing material.
        -  **Traditional**: The traditional metric for “word” in the context of
           keyboarding is defined to be 5 characters per word, including spaces.
           This is compatible with the notion of “word” in many typing speed
           utilities.
        -  **Spaces**: A word is a whitespace-separated sequence of characters.
           This metric of course doesn’t take into account the fact that some
           words are longer than others, both in length and syllables.
        
        The meters look like this:
