# solo-python

## Prerequisites
Python >= 3.6

## Installation
We require Python3.6+.

Running `pip install solo-python` installs both the `solo` library
and the `solotool` interface.

## Solo Tool
For help, run `solotool --help`.

## Library Usage
Refactoring into a library is work in progress; current example:
```python
import solo

client = solo.client.SoloClient()
client.find_device()

client.wink()

random_bytes = client.get_rng(32)
```
