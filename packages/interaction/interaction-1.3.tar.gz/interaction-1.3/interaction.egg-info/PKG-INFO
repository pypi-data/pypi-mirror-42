Description: # Interaction
        Interaction is a Python package for creating nice and colourful progress bars using the map() and apply() method as well as for loops.
        
        ## ProgressBar
        To use a progress bar you need to initiate a ProgressBar object with the maximum progress amount (total) and call the show method of the object with the amount to update the progress bar.
        
        ```python
        from interaction import ProgressBar
        from time import sleep
        
        bar = ProgressBar(total=100)
        
        for i in range(100):
          sleep(0.05)
          bar.show(amount=i+1)
        ```
        
        You can also add your own text to the progress bar.
        
        ```python
        from interaction import ProgressBar
        from time import sleep
        
        bar = ProgressBar(total=100)
        for i in range(100):
            sleep(0.05)
            bar.show(amount=i+1, text=f'working on {i}')
        ```
        
        
        ## map
        You can also use the ProgressBar's map method instead of Python's map method. The output is an iterable. As soon as you turn the iterable object into a list the progress bar will be displayed.
        
        ```python
        from interaction import ProgressBar
        from time import sleep
        
        list1 = list(range(100))
        
        def wait_and_double(x, wait_time):
            sleep(wait_time)
            return x*2
        
        # this will not make the progress bar appear
        iterable2 = ProgressBar.map(
            function=lambda x: wait_and_double(x=x, wait_time=0.05), 
            iterable=list1
        )
        
        # this will make the progress bar appear
        list2 = list(iterable2)
        ```
        
        ## apply
        ProgressBar also works with Panda's DataFrame and Series objects. 
        
        ```python
        from interaction import ProgressBar
        from time import sleep
        from pandas import DataFrame
        
        data = DataFrame({
            'name':['Arminius', 'Boudica', 'Alaric', 'Attila', 'Genseric'],
            'ethnicity': ['German', 'Celt', 'Goth', 'Hun', 'Vandal']
        })
        
        data['name_and_ethnicity'] = ProgressBar.apply(
            data=data, 
            function=lambda x: x['name']+' the '+x['ethnicity']
        )
        
        data['name_lower'] = ProgressBar.apply(
            series=data['name'], 
            function=lambda x: x.lower()
        )
        ```
        
        ## iterate
        You can also use ProgressBar to for iterating over iterable objects, especially *for* loops.
        
        ```python
        from interaction import iterate
        
        for i in iterate(range(100)):
            # do something
            pass
        ```
