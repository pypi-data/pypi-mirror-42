        ## Description
        
        The **Andalusian varieties of [Spanish]** (Spanish: *andaluz*; Andalusian) are spoken in Andalusia, Ceuta, Melilla, and Gibraltar. They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish, differing in many respects from northern varieties, and also from Standard Spanish. Further info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_Spanish.
        
        This application provides with a basic [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) spanish *po files* transliteration tool, using [andaluh-py](https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-py) package. Further info: https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-py
