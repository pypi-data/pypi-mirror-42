.. _`Development`:

Development
===========

This section only needs to be read by developers of the zhmccli package.
People that want to make a fix or develop some extension, and people that
want to test the project are also considered developers for the purpose of
this section.


.. _`Code of Conduct Section`:

Code of Conduct
---------------

Help us keep the zhmccli package open and inclusive. Please read and follow our
`Code of Conduct`_.

.. _Code of Conduct: https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmccli/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md


.. _`Repository`:

Repository
----------

The source code repository for the zhmccli package is on GitHub:

https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmccli


.. _`Setting up the development environment`:

Setting up the development environment
--------------------------------------

The development environment is pretty easy to set up.

Besides having a supported operating system with a supported Python version
(see :ref:`Supported environments`), it is recommended that you set up a
`virtual Python environment`_.

.. _virtual Python environment: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Then, with a virtual Python environment active, clone the Git repo of this
project and prepare the development environment with ``make develop``:

.. code-block:: text

    $ git clone git@github.com:zhmcclient/zhmccli.git
    $ cd zhmccli
    $ make develop

This will install all prerequisites the package needs to run, as well as all
prerequisites that you need for development.

Generally, this project uses Make to do things in the currently active
Python environment. The command ``make help`` (or just ``make``) displays a
list of valid Make targets and a short description of what each target does.


.. _`Building the documentation`:

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The ReadTheDocs (RTD) site is used to publish the documentation for the
zhmccli package at http://zhmccli.readthedocs.io/

This page automatically gets updated whenever the ``master`` branch of the
Git repo for this package changes.

In order to build the documentation locally from the Git work directory, issue:

.. code-block:: text

    $ make builddoc

The top-level document to open with a web browser will be
``build_doc/html/docs/index.html``.


.. _`Testing`:

Testing
-------

To run unit tests in the currently active Python environment, issue one of
these example variants of ``make test``:

.. code-block:: text

    $ make test                                  # Run all unit tests
    $ TESTCASES=test_resource.py make test       # Run only this test source file
    $ TESTCASES=TestInit make test               # Run only this test class
    $ TESTCASES="TestInit or TestSet" make test  # py.test -k expressions are possible

To run the unit tests and some more commands that verify the project is in good
shape in all supported Python environments, use Tox:

.. code-block:: text

    $ tox                              # Run all tests on all supported Python versions
    $ tox -e py27                      # Run all tests on Python 2.7
    $ tox -e py27 test_resource.py     # Run only this test source file on Python 2.7
    $ tox -e py27 TestInit             # Run only this test class on Python 2.7
    $ tox -e py27 TestInit or TestSet  # py.test -k expressions are possible

The positional arguments of the ``tox`` command are passed to ``py.test`` using
its ``-k`` option. Invoke ``py.test --help`` for details on the expression
syntax of its ``-k`` option.


.. _`Contributing`:

Contributing
------------

Third party contributions to this project are welcome!

In order to contribute, create a `Git pull request`_, considering this:

.. _Git pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

* Test is required.
* Each commit should only contain one "logical" change.
* A "logical" change should be put into one commit, and not split over multiple
  commits.
* Large new features should be split into stages.
* The commit message should not only summarize what you have done, but explain
  why the change is useful.
* The commit message must follow the format explained below.

What comprises a "logical" change is subject to sound judgement. Sometimes, it
makes sense to produce a set of commits for a feature (even if not large).
For example, a first commit may introduce a (presumably) compatible API change
without exploitation of that feature. With only this commit applied, it should
be demonstrable that everything is still working as before. The next commit may
be the exploitation of the feature in other components.

For further discussion of good and bad practices regarding commits, see:

* `OpenStack Git Commit Good Practice`_
* `How to Get Your Change Into the Linux Kernel`_

.. _OpenStack Git Commit Good Practice: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages
.. _How to Get Your Change Into the Linux Kernel: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst


.. _`Format of commit messages`:

Format of commit messages
-------------------------

A commit message must start with a short summary line, followed by a blank
line.

Optionally, the summary line may start with an identifier that helps
identifying the type of change or the component that is affected, followed by
a colon.

It can include a more detailed description after the summary line. This is
where you explain why the change was done, and summarize what was done.

It must end with the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) sign-off line in the
format shown in the example below, using your name and a valid email address of
yours. The DCO sign-off line certifies that you followed the rules stated in
`DCO 1.1`_. In short, you certify that you wrote the patch or otherwise have
the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

.. _DCO 1.1: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhmcclient/zhmccli/master/DCO1.1.txt

We use `GitCop`_ during creation of a pull request to check whether the commit
messages in the pull request comply to this format.
If the commit messages do not comply, GitCop will add a comment to the pull
request with a description of what was wrong.

.. _GitCop: http://gitcop.com/

Example commit message:

.. code-block:: text

    cookies: Add support for delivering cookies

    Cookies are important for many people. This change adds a pluggable API for
    delivering cookies to the user, and provides a default implementation.

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>

Use ``git commit --amend`` to edit the commit message, if you need to.

Use the ``--signoff`` (``-s``) option of ``git commit`` to append a sign-off
line to the commit message with your name and email as known by Git.

If you like filling out the commit message in an editor instead of using
the ``-m`` option of ``git commit``, you can automate the presence of the
sign-off line by using a commit template file:

* Create a file outside of the repo (say, ``~/.git-signoff.template``)
  that contains, for example:

  .. code-block:: text

      <one-line subject>

      <detailed description>

      Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>

* Configure Git to use that file as a commit template for your repo:

  .. code-block:: text

      git config commit.template ~/.git-signoff.template


.. _`Releasing a version`:

Releasing a version
-------------------

This section shows the steps for releasing a version to `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/>`_.

Switch to your work directory of the zhmccli Git repo (this is where
the ``Makefile`` is), and perform the following steps in that directory:

1.  Set a shell variable for the version to be released, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: text

        MNU='0.11.0'

2.  Verify that your working directory is in a Git-wise clean state:

    .. code-block:: text

        git status

3.  Check out the ``master`` branch, and update it from upstream:

    .. code-block:: text

        git checkout master
        git pull

4.  Create a topic branch for the release, based upon the ``master`` branch:

    .. code-block:: text

        git checkout -b release-$MNU

5.  Edit the change log (``docs/changes.rst``) and perform the following
    changes in the top-most section (that is the section for the version to be
    released):

    * If needed, change the version in the section heading to the version to be
      released, e.g.:

      .. code-block:: text

          Version 0.11.0
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Change the release date to today's date, e.g.:

      .. code-block:: text

          Released: 2017-03-16

    * Make sure that the change log entries reflect all changes since the
      previous version, and make sure they are relevant for and
      understandable by users.

    * In the "Known issues" list item, remove the link to the issue tracker
      and add any known issues you want users to know about. Just linking
      to the issue tracker quickly becomes incorrect for released versions:

      .. code-block:: text

          **Known issues:**

          * ....

    * Remove all empty list items in the change log section for this release.

6.  Commit your changes and push them upstream:

    .. code-block:: text

        git add docs/changes.rst
        git commit -sm "Updated change log for $MNU release."
        git push --set-upstream origin release-$MNU

7.  On GitHub, create a pull request for branch ``release-$MNU``.

8.  Perform a complete test:

    .. code-block:: text

        tox

    This should not fail because the same tests have already been run in the
    Travis CI. However, run it for additional safety before the release.

    * If this test fails, fix any issues until the test succeeds. Commit the
      changes and push them upstream:

      .. code-block:: text

          git add <changed-files>
          git commit -sm "<change description with details>"
          git push

      Wait for the automatic tests to show success for this change.

9.  Once the CI tests on GitHub are complete, merge the pull request.

10. Update your local ``master`` branch:

    .. code-block:: text

        git checkout master
        git pull

11. Tag the ``master`` branch with the release label and push the tag
    upstream:

    .. code-block:: text

        git tag $MNU
        git push --tags

12. On GitHub, edit the new tag, and create a release description on it. This
    will cause it to appear in the Release tab.

    You can see the tags in GitHub via Code -> Releases -> Tags.

13. Upload the package to PyPI:

    .. code-block:: text

        make upload

    This will show the package version and will ask for confirmation.

    **Attention!!** This only works once for each version. You cannot
    release the same version twice to PyPI.

14. Verify that the released version is shown on PyPI:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zhmccli/

15. Verify that RTD shows the released version as its stable version:

    https://zhmccli.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#versioning

    Note: RTD builds the documentation automatically, but it may take a few
    minutes to do so.

16. On GitHub, close milestone ``M.N.U``.


.. _`Starting a new version`:

Starting a new version
----------------------

This section shows the steps for starting development of a new version.

These steps may be performed right after the steps for
:ref:`releasing a version`, or independently.

This description works for releases that are direct successors of the previous
release. It does not cover starting a new version that is a fix release to a
version that was released earlier.

Switch to your work directory of the zhmccli Git repo (this is where
the ``Makefile`` is), and perform the following steps in that directory:

1.  Set a shell variable for the new version to be started:

    .. code-block:: text

        MNU='0.12.0'

2.  Verify that your working directory is in a git-wise clean state:

    .. code-block:: text

        git status

3.  Check out the ``master`` branch, and update it from upstream:

    .. code-block:: text

        git checkout master
        git pull

4.  Create a topic branch for the release, based upon the ``master`` branch:

    .. code-block:: text

        git checkout -b start-$MNU

5.  Edit the change log (``docs/changes.rst``) and insert the following section
    before the top-most section (which is the section about the latest released
    version):

    .. code-block:: text

        Version 0.12.0
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Released: not yet

        **Incompatible changes:**

        **Deprecations:**

        **Bug fixes:**

        **Enhancements:**

        **Known issues:**

        * See `list of open issues`_.

        .. _`list of open issues`: https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmccli/issues

6.  Commit your changes and push them upstream:

    .. code-block:: text

        git add docs/changes.rst
        git commit -sm "Started $MNU release."
        git push --set-upstream origin start-$MNU

7.  On GitHub, create a pull request for branch ``start-$MNU``.

8.  On GitHub, create a new milestone for development of the next release,
    e.g. ``M.N.U``.

    You can create a milestone in GitHub via Issues -> Milestones -> New
    Milestone.

9.  On GitHub, go through all open issues and pull requests that still have
    milestones for previous releases set, and either set them to the new
    milestone, or to have no milestone.

10. Once the CI tests on GitHub are complete, merge the pull request.

11. Update your local ``master`` branch:

    .. code-block:: text

        git checkout master
        git pull
