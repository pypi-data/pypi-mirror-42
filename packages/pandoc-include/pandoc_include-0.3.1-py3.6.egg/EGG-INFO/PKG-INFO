Description: pandoc-include
        ==============
        
        Pandoc filter to allow file includes.
        
        The filter script is based on `User Guide for
        Panflute <http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/guide.html#using-the-included-batteries>`__.
        This repository is to provide a simple way to install and use it.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Use pip to install:
        
        ::
        
           pip install --user pandoc-include
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Command
        ~~~~~~~
        
        To use this filter, add to pandoc command
        
        ::
        
           pandoc input.md --filter pandoc-include -o output.pdf
        
        Syntax
        ~~~~~~
        
        Each include statement has its own line and has the syntax:
        
        ::
        
           !include ../somefolder/somefile
        
        Or
        
        ::
        
           $include ../somefolder/somefile
        
        Each include statement must be in its own paragraph. That is, in its own
        line and separated by blank lines.
        
        Recursive include is supported from v0.3.0.
        
        If no extension was given, “.md” is assumed.
        
        **Note:** The second syntax may lead to wrong highlighting when using a
        markdown editor. If it happens, use the first syntax.
