Description: pandoc-include
        ==============
        
        Pandoc filter to allow file includes.
        
        The filter script is originally from `User Guide for
        Panflute <http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/guide.html#using-the-included-batteries>`__.
        This repository is to provide a simple way to install and use it.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Use pip to install:
        
        ::
        
           pip install pandoc-include
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Each include statement has its own line and has the syntax:
        
        ::
        
           $include ../somefolder/somefile
        
        Each include statement must be in its own paragraph. That is, in its own
        line and separated by blank lines.
        
        If no extension was given, “.md” is assumed.
