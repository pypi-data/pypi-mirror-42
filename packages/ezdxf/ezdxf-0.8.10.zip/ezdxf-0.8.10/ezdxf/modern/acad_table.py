    #
    # REMARK from Autodesk:
    # Group code 178 is a flag value for a virtual edge. A virtual edge is used when a grid line is shared by two cells.
    # For example, if a table contains one row and two columns and it contains cell A and cell B, the central grid line
    # contains the right edge of cell A and the left edge of cell B. One edge is real, and the other edge is virtual.
    # The virtual edge points to the real edge; both edges have the same set of properties, including color, lineweight,
    # and visibility.
