# Conform

A simple config generator, inspired by [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and 
[terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Very alpha. Do not use this yet.

# Development

You can use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) if you would like to work on this 
project locally.

```bash
docker build -t conform .
```

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "${PWD}:/conform" conform bash
```

Windows: If volume is not linked correctly. Check Docker is allowed access to C: 
drive. (Reset credentials)
