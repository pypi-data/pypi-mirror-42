"""Molecule tunnel discretization tool.

Usage:
  discretizer -f | --file <in-filename> [--delta <delta>] [-o <out-filename>] [-t <threads>]

Options:
  -h --help                         Show this help.
  -f --file                         File containing information about tunnel in molecule in PDB format.
  -o --output-file <out-filename>   Dump disks to file in dsd format.
  --delta <delta>                   Maximal distance between disks.
  -t --threads <threads>            Number of threads used for calculation. Default: number of cores.
