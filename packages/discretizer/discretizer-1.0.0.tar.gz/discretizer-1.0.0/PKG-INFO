Description: # Tunnel discretizer
        Tunnel discretization tool used to transform tunnel in protein molecule
        leading to active site of it to a sequence of disks that enclose the tunnel and
        are not consequently distant by more than `delta`.
        
        ## Usage
        Generally used as `python discretizer.py -f tunnel.pdb --delta 0.3`. For
        more details see `python discretizer.py --help`.
