Introduction
------------
VITABS is a guitar tab editor inspired by the legendary Vi text editor.  It is
created with convenient editing and fast keyboard entry in mind.  Keyboard
mappings are modeled after Vi and Vim.

A more detailed documentation is available in the doc directory in Markdown
format.

The project is in a quite early stage, so many features are missing. Also, this
project started as an excersise in python and curses for me, so code quality may
not be at it's finest, still an effort is beeing taken to clean it up.


Requirements
------------
Python 2 and curses library are required to run VITABS.
python-portmidi is required for MIDI playback.


Features
--------
* Vi-like editing commands
* MIDI playback

Planned features include multiple tracks and plugin support.
