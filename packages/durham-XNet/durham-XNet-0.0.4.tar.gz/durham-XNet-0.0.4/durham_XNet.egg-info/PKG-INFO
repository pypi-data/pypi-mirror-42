Description: # XNet
        
        XNet is a Convolutional Neural Network designed for the segmentation
        of X-Ray images into bone, soft tissue and open beam
        regions. Specifically, it performs well on small datasets with the aim
        to minimise the number of false positives in the soft tissue class.
        
        ## Architecture
        
        ![](./Images/architecture.jpg)
        
        * Built on a typical encoder-decoder architecture as
        inspired by [SegNet](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/).
        
        * Additional feature extraction stage, with weight sharing across some
          layers.
        
        * Fine and coarse grained feature preservation through concatenation
          of layers.
        
        * L2 regularisation at each of the convolutional layers, to decrease overfitting. 
        
        The architecture is described in the ```XNet.py``` file.
        
        ## Output
        
        XNet outputs a mask of equal size to the input images.

        ## Training
        
        XNet is trained on a small dataset which has undergone
        augmention. Examples of this augmentation step can be found in the
        ```augmentations.ipynb``` notebook in the ```Augmentations``` folder. Similarly the ```Training``` folder contains python scripts that perform the necessary augementations.
        
        Running ```train.py``` from the ```Training``` folder calls various other scripts to perform one of two possible ways of augmenting the images:
        
        * 'On the fly augmentation' where a new set of augmentations is generated at each epoch.
        
        * Pre-augmented images.
        
        ## Benchmarking
        
        XNet was benchmarked against two of the leading segmentation networks:
        
        * Simplified [SegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561) (found in the
          ```SimpleSegNet.py``` file)
        
        * [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) (found in the ```UNet.py```
          file)
        
        ## Data
        
        We trained on a dataset of:
        
        * 150 X-Ray images.
        
        * No scatter correction.
        
        * 1500x1500 ```.tif``` image downsampled to 200x200
        
        * 20 human body part classes.
        
        * Highly imbalanced.
        
        As this work grew out of work with a corporation we are sadly unable to share the propriatory data we used.
