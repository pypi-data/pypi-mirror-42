        :info: An async IPFS_ browser
        
        **galacteek** is an experimental Qt5-based browser/toolbox
        for the IPFS_ peer-to-peer network.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        AppImage
        --------
        
        For Linux users (arch: *x86_64*), you can get an AppImage from the IPFS network
        `here <https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7>`_
        (**~138Mb**, release CID: **QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7**).
        
        Just fetch the image (with wget for example or your favorite tool), and execute
        it afterwards::
        
            wget https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7
            chmod u+x QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7
            ./QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7
        
        Or if you already have an IPFS daemon installed and running::
        
            ipfs get QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7
            chmod u+x QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7
            ./QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7
        
        Running the AppImage with the filename unchanged ensures that the
        application will automatically pin itself (it will pin through IPFS the
        AppImage that you are using). By doing so you can help redistributing the
        software faster to the nodes close to you. Renaming the binary disables the
        self-seeding feature::
        
            mv QmRdNCGFkZ1aZ8ZvihCyHokXr3vG7QF8ut1GnkU2s97oP7 Galacteek-0.3.5.AppImage
        
        **Note**: go-ipfs_ version *0.4.18* is included in the AppImage.
        For reference the AppImage is built with
        `this script <https://github.com/eversum/galacteek/blob/master/AppImage/galacteek-appimage-build>`_.
        You can use the same command-line arguments as with the regular *galacteek*
        runner script. If you are filing an issue, please use the *-d* switch and
        provide the debug output.
        
        PIP
        ---
        
        You need to have python>=3.5 (python>=3.6 is recommended) and pip installed,
        as well as go-ipfs_. From a virtualenv, or as root, install with:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip install galacteek
        
        Or building it from source:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            python setup.py build install
        
        Now just run the application with:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            galacteek
        
        If you don't have go-ipfs_ already installed, the application will ask you
        if you want to automatically download and install it from dist.ipfs.io_
        You need a recent version of go-ipfs_ (> 0.4.7) with the new DAG API.
        
        For the media player to work on Linux, you will need to install the
        *gstreamer* (1.x) package and all the gstreamer plugins.
        
        Command-line usage
        ==================
        
        Use the *-d* command-line switch to enable debugging. Using *--profile* gives
        you the ability to have separate application profiles (*main* is the default
        profile). Use *--help* for all options.
        
        *Development*: Use *--monitor* to enable event-loop monitoring with aiomonitor_
        (install aiomonitor_ manually as it's not a dependency).
        Then connect to the aiomonitor_ interface with **nc localhost 50101**
        
        Features
        ========
        
        **galacteek** can either spawn an IPFS daemon and use it as transport, or
        connect to an existing IPFS daemon. By default it will try to run a daemon. You
        can change the IPFS connection settings by clicking on the settings icon in the
        toolbar and restart the application afterwards.

        Platforms supported
        ===================
        
        Mainly tested on Linux. The application relies heavily on quamash_ which
        should work with most platforms (for OS X there are still some asyncio
        issues to fix).
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        - python3 >= 3.5.3 (it is strongly suggested to use python>=3.6)
        - go-ipfs_ > 0.4.7
        - qt5
        - PyQt5 with QtWebEngine support
        - gstreamer (on Linux) for media player support
        - quamash_
        - aiohttp_
        - aioipfs_
