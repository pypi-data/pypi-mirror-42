Description: # KeePass Library
        
        This library enables Robot Framework to interact with KeePass databases.
        
        Supported KeePass versions:
        - KDBX3
        - KDBX4
            
        KeepassLibrary uses the [PyKeePass](https://pypi.org/project/pykeepass/) modules internally to access KeePass databases
            
        See https://keepass.info for more information about KeePass in general
