    """Asynchronous interface to an input device.

    Runs a persistent while loop wherein the device is repeatedly polled for
    data. When the data becomes available, it is emitted and the loop
    continues.

    There are effectively two methods of this class: start and stop. These
    methods do as their names suggest -- they start and stop the underlying
    device from sampling new data.

    The device used to create the DaqStream is also accessible via the
    ``device`` attribute so you can change settings on the underlying device
    any time (e.g. sampling rate, number of samples per update, etc.).

    Parameters
    ----------
    device : daq

        :class:`NoiseGenerator` for an example.

    Attributes
    ----------
    updated : Transmitter
        Transmitted when the latest chunk of data is available. The data type
        depends on the underlying input device, but it is often a numpy
        ndarray.
    disconnected : Transmitter
        Transmitted if the device cannot be read from (it has disconnected
        somehow).
    finished : Transmitter
        Transmitted when the device has stopped and samping is finished.

    The keyboard device works by periodically sampling (with the rate

    sampling event. The output is a numpy array of shape ``(n_keys, 1)``, where
    the numerical values are booleans indicating whether or not the

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : int, optional

    keys : container of str, optional

    Notes
    -----
    There are a couple reasonable alternatives to the way the keyboard device
    is currently implemented. One way to do it might be sampling the key states
    at a given rate and producing segments of sampled key state data, much like
    a regular data acquisition device. One issue is that actual key state
    (whether the key is being physically pressed or not) doesn't seem to be
    feasible to find out with Qt. You can hook into key press and key release
    events, but these are subject to repeat delay and repeat rate.

    Another possible keyboard device would be responsive to key press events
    themselves rather than an input sampling event. While Qt enables
    event-based keyboard handling, the method used here fits the input device
    model, making it easily swappable with other input devices.
